This project's focus on uncovering potential vulnerabilities that could lead to mass wallet breaches is of paramount importance in an era where cryptocurrency usage is rapidly growing. Our focus on identifying scenarios where a provider could defraud all of its users simultaneously sheds light on a critical aspect of wallet security that often goes overlooked. With some wallets managing billions of dollars, the potential for providers to exploit these systems is a genuine concern. By addressing this issue, WalletScrutiny contributes to the protection of cryptocurrency users and their assets, making the digital financial landscape safer for everyone.


WalletScrutiny has received grants from [Spiral](https://twitter.com/spiralbtc/status/1593304684801966091) and [HRF](https://hrf.org/devfund2023q1).
