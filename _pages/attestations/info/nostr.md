Nostr is a protocol that allows users to communicate and share information without relying on centralized platforms. It uses public-key cryptography to ensure secure communication. Nostr is designed to be censorship-resistant and while best known for its use as a clone of <img src="/images/x_logo.svg" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;" alt="X Logo">, it is also used in many other applications.

## Getting Started with Nostr

### 2. Create Your Nostr Identity

After installing a browser extension, you'll need to create your Nostr identity. Here's how:

1. Click on the extension icon in your browser
1. Select "Create New Identity" or "Generate New Keys"
1. The extension will generate a public key (your Nostr ID) and a private key
1. **Important**: Make sure to backup your private key somewhere safe! If you lose it, you won't be able to access your Nostr identity
1. Your public key can be shared with others, but never share your private key

After completing these steps, you'll be ready to use Nostr-enabled websites and applications, including the [Attestations](/attestations/) feature on this website and contribute your opinions on wallets!
