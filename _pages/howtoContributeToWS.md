WalletScrutiny is pushing for accountability and auditability in Bitcoin wallet security. If this topic is dear to your heart, here are some ways how you can help us.

- [Fund the Project](#fund-the-project)
- [Create Issues](#create-issues)
- [Propose Changes on Social Media](#propose-changes-on-social-media)
- [Propose Addition of a New Product](#propose-addition-of-a-new-product)

## Fund the project

WalletScrutiny is not selling any product and relies 100% on donations and grants.

Your donations will support the expenses needed to keep the project - and more importantly, the contributors, going. Security research, the development and design and the high level review of now over 6000 products cost experts a lot of time. You can keep them happy with either a [donation](https://walletscrutiny.com/donate/) or by directly sponsoring a contributor with a grant.

## Create Issues

The project maintains a GitLab page where we organize activities around [**Issues**](https://gitlab.com/walletscrutiny/walletScrutinyCom/-/issues). If we find a wallet that claims to be **self-custodial** and **source-available**, this is where we put it.

⭐ **You** can also create issues if you find anything of note pertaining to the project. Simply head over [here](https://gitlab.com/walletscrutiny/walletScrutinyCom/-/issues).

## Propose Addition of a New Product

We encourage wallet providers to add their product to our database. If the product is source-available, we'd also value detailed instructions on how to build the app. This saves us time when performing reproducible builds.

⭐ Even better than products presented by their own providers are reviews by neutral third parties. Or additional reviews of already reviewed products to make sure the information is correct.
