WalletScrutiny aims to promote accountability and auditability in Bitcoin wallet security. Hereâ€™s how you can contribute:

**Create Attestations:** Create attestations for wallets you have tried to verify. More info [here](/attestations/).

**Write Opinions:** Share your insights on Bitcoin apps or devices, including opposing views. Write an opinion on a wallet. It will be shared to NOSTR to extend discussions beyond this website.

**Spread the Word:** Engage with us on platforms like X.com, Nostr, Discord, Facebook, and Reddit. Open communication helps verify and improve reproducibility in wallet builds.

**Write Reviews:** If you find an existing review lacking, update it via GitLab by cloning the repository, making your changes, and submitting a merge request.

**Add Products:** Wallet providers and third parties can add new products or reviews to our database. Detailed build instructions for source-available products are highly valued.

**Contribute to Issue Tracker:** Help us track issues by creating, commenting on, or fixing issues in our [GitLab issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/walletscrutiny/walletScrutinyCom/-/issues).

**Fund the Project:** Support our work through donations or grants, ensuring the project and its contributors continue their vital security research.
