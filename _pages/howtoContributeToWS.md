WalletScrutiny aims to promote accountability and auditability in Bitcoin wallet security. Hereâ€™s how you can contribute:

    **Write Opinions:** Share your insights on Bitcoin apps or devices, including opposing views. Use the Nostr Opinion Plugin to extend discussions beyond the website.

    **Spread the Word:** Engage with us on platforms like X.com, Nostr, Discord, Facebook, and Reddit. Open communication helps verify and improve reproducibility in wallet builds.

    **Write Reviews:** If you find an existing review lacking, update it via GitLab by cloning the repository, making your changes, and submitting a merge request.

    **Add Products:** Wallet providers and third parties can add new products or reviews to our database. Detailed build instructions for source-available products are highly valued.

    **Contribute to Issue Tracker:** Help us track issues by creating, commenting on, or fixing issues in our GitLab issue tracker. Use the interactive issue board to manage tasks.

    **Fund the Project:** Support our work through donations or grants, ensuring the project and its contributors continue their vital security research.
