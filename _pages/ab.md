# Who am I?

* Leo Wandersleb
* Long time Bitcoin follower
* 5 years full time wallet developer, 4 of which as release manager

# The Wallets we use - What could possibly go wrong?

As Bitcoiners we have to make a few choices:

* What to use for daily spending?
* Where to store long term savings?
* How to secure backups?

# What to use for daily spending?

Mobile wallets - Probably Android or iPhone

## Beware the shitcoins! At least 50 of them claim to be "the real Bitcoin"

## Beware the Fakes! At least 5% of all apps are pretending to be what they are not!

* Emanuel had found +700 of further products that were gone from Play Store
later when we got to looking into them.
* Avoid apps with few installs although the most successful fake apps did achieve
tens of thousands of installs.

## Obfuscation is a red flag! - ++1%

```
password = "ABC"

if (input == password) {
  sendFunds()
}
```

```
_x1 = "C"
_x2 = _x1 + "BA"
_x3 = _x2.reverse()
_v6 == _x3 && _f1()
```

## Can't send or receive actual Bitcoin - 7%

* There might not even be any bitcoins involved. Only exposure to an index.

## Not your keys, not your coins! - 60%!!

* Exchanges like Binance have 50 Million downloads
* KYC? - Know Your Custodian!
* Proof of reserves?
* "Fully Regulated!" - Change in policy in the custodian's jurisdiction?
* Change in management
* Get hacked - "MtGox was handling over 70% of Bitcoin trades" - 2014-02-07 - lost 744,408 bitcoins in a "theft which went undetected for years".
* "Get hacked" / lose the coins - The only guy who knows where QuadricaCX' coins are stored died in India and now all the money is gone. Sorry. ...

## "Self Custody"

The above categories are a total of 72% of all apps on Google Play. So the other
38% are self custodial?

* What if the app stops working? Is my backup compatible with other apps?
* Do I have a way to backup my wallet?
* Does the provider **also** have a backup of my wallet? How can I know? How can
  the provider prove he doesn't?

## 21% of the apps claim to be self-custodial but do not share any source code

So they don't have the same obligations that most jurisdictions impose on
custodians but you have to take their word for you being in sole control of your
coins.

## 3% are hard to compile from the source provided



## 2% can be compiled into a Bitcoin wallet

## 1% can be compiled into the same Bitcoin wallet that is published on Google Play

* Reproducibility is the gold standard for "binary transparency"

(Pierre-Simon de Laplace, 1749–1827, Rien ne serait incertain pour elle, et
l'avenir, comme le passé, serait présent à ses yeux.)

* Ingredient lists might contain opaque items like "Ready made bread mix"
* "Manufactured in a facility which processes nuts"

# Where to store long term savings?



# How to secure backups?
