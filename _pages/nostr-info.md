<p>Nostr is a decentralized social network protocol that allows users to communicate and share information without relying on centralized platforms. It uses cryptographic keys and public-key cryptography to ensure secure and private communication. Nostr is designed to be open-source, decentralized, and censorship-resistant, providing a more secure and private alternative to traditional social media platforms.</p>

<h2>Getting Started with Nostr</h2>

<h3>1. Install a Nostr Browser Extension</h3>

<p>To interact with Nostr, you'll need to install a browser extension that manages your Nostr identity. Here are some popular options:</p>

<ul>

            <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nos2x-fox/">Download for Firefox</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/alby-bitcoin-lightning-wal/iokeahhehimjnekafflcihljlcjccdbe">Download for Chrome/Brave</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/alby/">Download for Firefox</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Create Your Nostr Identity</h3>

<p>After installing a browser extension, you'll need to create your Nostr identity. Here's how:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Click on the extension icon in your browser</li>
    <li>Select "Create New Identity" or "Generate New Keys"</li>
    <li>The extension will generate a public key (your Nostr ID) and a private key</li>
    <li><strong>Important</strong>: Make sure to backup your private key somewhere safe! If you lose it, you won't be able to access your Nostr identity</li>
    <li>Your public key can be shared with others, but never share your private key</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have completed these steps, you're ready to start using Nostr-enabled websites and applications, including the Attestations functionality on this website!</p>
