    analysis: "Coinbaseâ€™s cold storage has gone through a number of evolutions through the years as the cryptocurrency space has evolved and matured. Coinbaseâ€™s standard for truly cold storage is that multiple geographically separated humans in the real world should be forced to perform physical actions to enable a transaction after reviewing transaction details. If that isnâ€™t true, we donâ€™t think itâ€™s actually cold storage."
