Additional Information: 

Coinbase's Threshold Signing Service (TSS) is a core part of its custody solution, ensuring:

- Private keys are never fully exposed at any stage.
- Multiparty cryptographic signing replaces traditional key reconstruction.
- Nonce protection and validation processes prevent private key leaks.
- Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) enforce physical security.
- Encryption, access control, and hybrid participation reduce risks.
- These methods enhance the security of Coinbaseâ€™s custodial wallets, protecting billions in customer assets from hacks, insider threats, and cryptographic attacks.
