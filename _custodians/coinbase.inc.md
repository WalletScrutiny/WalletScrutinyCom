Coinbase Pro, launched in 2012 as GDAX (Global Digital Asset Exchange) before rebranding in May 23, 2018, is the professional trading platform of Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. Based in the United States and regulated by multiple jurisdictions, it serves as a major fiat-to-crypto gateway and institutional-grade custodian for digital assets.

The platform implements a sophisticated custody solution that combines offline cold storage for the majority of assets with insured hot wallets for daily trading operations. As a regulated US entity, Coinbase Pro maintains strict compliance with federal and state regulations, including SOC certifications, and has established itself as one of the most trusted names in cryptocurrency custody.

Despite its strong security track record and institutional focus, Coinbase Pro operates as a fully custodial service where users do not control their private keys. The platform balances security with usability through features like whitelisted withdrawal addresses, time locks, and multi-user accounts for institutional clients, while maintaining high liquidity and trading functionality for active traders.
