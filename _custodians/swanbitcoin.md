      - information: Swan Bitcoin Acknowledges Exposure to Prime Trust Bankruptcy in Court Filing
        date: 2024-02-07
        source: Udi Wertheimer on X
        source_url: https://x.com/udiWertheimer/status/1889427267765543377
        corroborating_source: In re Prime Core Technologies., et al. Case No. 23-11161
        corroborating_source_url: https://archive.is/w7ePl
        refuting: This is a misreading of the filing. Swan is fighting a potentially bad precedent being set in courts for trust company bankruptcy. Swan had a small amount of funds held back relating to a reserve account that did not affect clients. All clients are whole and have custody with Bakkt, BitGo, or Equity Trust. Swan does not hold and has not ever held client funds. Most Bitcoin purchased using Swan has been withdrawn to self custody.
