## Product Description

This Bitcoin point-of-sale device built on a Verifone Verix V did not go beyond the planning stages.

> The Casascius Bitcoin POS system is a desktop retail point-of-sale acceptance system for Bitcoin "in a box". The system is based on a VeriFone Vx510 or Vx570 payment terminal, and allows merchants to easily accept Bitcoin payments from customers. It can optionally allow merchants to dispense (sell) Bitcoins.
>
> The POS system features an Ethernet network connection, a 128x64 pixel backlit monochrome display, a receipt printer, and a 24-key keypad, all in a compact terminal. The Vx570 terminal also includes a USB port, to which a QR barcode scanner can be attached.
>
> The POS system acts as a client for a central server run by Somebody, Inc. It does not maintain a Bitcoin block chain, but rather, sends SSL-encrypted queries to servers belonging to Somebody, Inc. in order to retrieve rate quotes and perform transactions. Consequently, it requires a constant Internet connection in order to function. Transactions cannot take place and rates cannot be quoted without a functional connection to the Internet.
>
> The POS system and its server are an open source project that is mainly in the **planning stage**. The POS system is not fully functional.

The item has been in the planning stages for 13 years now - enough to qualify it as **vaporware**.
