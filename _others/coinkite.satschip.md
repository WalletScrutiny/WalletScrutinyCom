## Product Description 

> ### What is SATSCHIP?
> It's a tiny wireless NFC chip that holds a Bitcoin private key (XPRV) and is designed to be embedded into physical works of art.
>
> ### For Collectors
>
> - Prove you own a particular piece by signing a message using it's private key (just tap it).
> - Any one can tap and see verification status, making the art un-clonable.
> - Verifiable entropy, meaning you know 100% that no one but the SATSCHIP itself has the private key.
>
> ### For Artists
> - Attach a Bitcoin private key to your works!
> - Verify with a tap of any mobile phone.
> - Tiny (30x30mm or 1 inch square), thin, and flexible! Also available as PVC card.
> - An image of your work can be uploaded here. After a tap, it will be shown, along with authorship and other meta data.
> - Open special options, all of which require physical ownership of the artwork.
