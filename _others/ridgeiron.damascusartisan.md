## Analysis 

The higher tiers ($299 above) come with a stamp kit that should allow the user to physically stamp the mnemonics on the wallet base.

There is a mention of a "[Blockchain Iron iPhone app](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1173199625/cold-storage-wallet-for-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrenci/posts/2378750)" that lets users check the balances of their wallets. We were not able to locate this app. 

Regardless of this information, the schema is BIP39 compliant. This should allow users to stamp their mnemonics and check their balances from any BIP39 compliant wallet. Note however, that recovering the mnemonic phrases on another device could potentially **expose the private keys on said device**.
