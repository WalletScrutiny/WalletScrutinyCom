## Analysis

From the Amazon.com description we find that included in the package are the following:

> Mobile DarkNet Starter Pack
> - Portable Podcast Receiver
> - Portable Password Manager
> - Portable Firefox
> - Portable Mail & News client
> - uTorrent
> - 100s more portable apps you can download for free

These are apps you could usually find in a linux live-distribution. Sadly, Linux was not mentioned in the description. With no website, no results when searching for "BetterWorldATL", and no further details, we can only guess what else is included in this USB drive. 

Suffice to say for our verdict, that a USB drive has to be plugged to a computer. Thus, if it includes a Bitcoin wallet, it **has to share information, including the private keys** to the main device.
