## Product Description 

Just as the name implies, {{ page.title }} is a portal for bitcoin gift cards. They add a 40 to 60 EURO surcharge to the average market rate.

This is how it works:

From the FAQ: 

>
**How can I use the Bitcoins on the gift card?**
The Bitcoins on the Gift Card are absolutely safe from hacker attacks before they are digitized. There is no way to get the Bitcoins, as they are currently only stored on a “sheet of paper”.
Thus, the Bitcoins are completely separated from the Internet. On the other hand, there is no way to restore the Bitcoins if you lose the Bitcoin gift card.
>
It must therefore be stored with special care. We recommend storing the Bitcoin Gift Card in a safe deposit box.
We hold on to it:
>
-  Bitcoins on the gift card are absolutely safe from hacker attacks if they are not digitized.
-  Anyone who loses the card has no way of restoring the Bitcoins.
>
You can think of your Bitcoin Gift Card as a Bitcoin purse. A certain number of Bitcoins are stored on it. When the day comes that you finally want to send your Bitcoins, you need another Bitcoin “purse”.
>
We recommend either a Smartphone Wallet (so you can conveniently use the QR Code) or a Desktop Wallet for your computer. Which one you choose is up to you. The procedure is always the same. You need to digitize your Bitcoins to send them.

## Analysis 

While the product/service is straightforward, the **private keys are printed on the medium**. The provider themselves prints it. Users can opt to receive an encrypted PDF for them to print it out themselves. There's no specification how the provider processes this. Needless to say, the file has to be transmitted through the Internet.
