## Background 

> The Xanthrax Floppy Disk Edition comes with a holographic image of Xanthrax. The disk is sealed with a security sticker which has to be broken to run the floppy disk and access the associated private key containing the digital Xanthrax blockchain trading card as a PDF in the shape of a certificate, designed by a professional designer.
>
> Each of the 50 Xanthrax floppy disks also comes with a sequentially numbered, signed, printed and laminated certificate of authenticity.
> 
> This crypto collectible trading card runs on the Bitcoin blockchain using the Counterparty protocol.
> 
> Buying this product directly supports the development of the Age of Chains trading card game.

## Product Description 

From the [Terms and Conditions](https://www.ageofchains.com/terms/)

> This Is Not a Currency, Stock or Equity: ​The Age of Chains Cards are virtual private tokens. Thus they are not “real equity” and carry no voting rights or any legally binding claim to any tangible or intangible assets. The digital tokens associated with Age of Chains Cards are intended only for accessing the ingame functionality of the acquired Age of Chains Cards within  the Age of Chains software after its development is completed, and does not represent “security” or “equity” stake in this project.

## Can it be used as a wallet? 

This [blog post](https://www.ageofchains.com/blog/) claims that it can: 

> In 1980, Sony developed the first 3.5 inch floppy drive and for more than a decade, floppy disks became the most popular way to store data. Since then, many other storage alternatives popped up and the floppy disk only remained as a relique from our childhood. However, with Age of Chains, we understand and value the beauty and endurance of our so beloved floppy disks. Thus, we are pushing its renaissance by making them a convenient way to store Age of Chains blockchain trading cards as a floppy disk hardware wallet.
>
> Our first limited floppy disk edition is based on Xanthrax (Series 2 Card 016). The edition is limited to 50 floppy disks only, making it a unique crypto collectible for anyone interested in NFTs, crypto gaming and physical blockchain collectibles.
>
> The limited Xanthrax floppy disk hardware wallet comes with a holographic image of Xanthrax. Additionally, the disk is sealed with a security sticker which has to be broken to run the floppy disk and access the associated private key containing the digital Xanthrax blockchain trading card. The card comes as a PDF in the shape of a certificate, designed by a professional designer.
>
> Furthermore, each of the 50 floppy disks comes with a printed certificate of authenticity. The certificates are numbered sequentially and hand signed by Age of Chains’ CEO Kilian Kunst. The certificate also comes laminated, preventing it from taking damage from fluids or from being bent. This way, beyond the digital trading card stored on the disk, you will enjoy two physical collectibles in one: the limited floppy disk as well a physical version of the certificate.
>
> The Xanthrax crypto collectible trading card runs on the Bitcoin blockchain using the Counterparty protocol, which means that each Age of Chains wallet at the same time can also be used as a regular Bitcoin wallet.

## Analysis 

It is also stated in the Terms that: 

> (The User) represents and warrants that Purchaser is not exchanging bitcoin (BTC) or XCP for Age of Chains Cards for the purpose of speculative investment

Despite claims that it can also be used as a "regular Bitcoin wallet", we are filing this to *other*.
