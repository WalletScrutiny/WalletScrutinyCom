> The SecuX Stream Pro is an offline payment framework including P22 payment terminal, App SDK and server container and it is designed for payment service provider, not for consumers and merchants.

On [its homepage](https://secuxtech.com/secux-payment-terminal), it is described as the "World’s first Bluetooth LE payment crypto payment solution."

In order to evaluate the product, potential users have to request for an [Payment Evaluation Kit](https://secuxtech.com/secuxtech-download/Payment-EvKit/EvKit-Quick-Start-Guide.pdf). 

Initially, information that's readily available about this device describes the process as:

> 01 Merchant Authorization <br />
Upon entering the correct amount at cashier, SecuX StreamPro enables crypto payment by generating a scannable one-time QR code.
>
> 02 Customer Confirmation <br />
> Customer confirms and processes payment with biometric authentication such as fingerprint or facial recognition.

## The Devices

There are two main devices, the P22 and the P20. Either of these come with the SecuX evPay app, the app SDK, the merchant dashboard portal account and the API.  

The device pictured on this review is the P22. 

> P22 - Designed with a keyboard and dual LCD displays (merchant-facing and consumer-facing). P22 is designed for placing on the checkout counter in the store. It can be powered by a fixed USB power source or AA battery.

## SecuX evPay

The Android app for the SecuX evPay can be found [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.secuxtech.mysecuxpay). 

We installed the app and it required registration. After we registered, the app detected that our phone did not have NFC. It then asked us to pair the app via bluetooth to another device. We assume that the other device should be the P22. 

This process is further described on [this PDF file](https://secuxtech.com/secuxtech-download/Payment-EvKit/EvKit-Quick-Start-Guide.pdf).

## Analysis 

The evaluation kit is a demo account that uses tokens and not actual cryptocurrency. We would have to verify with SecuX if the P22 device does have a wallet or whether they **host wallets on their account** via the Merchant Dashboard.
