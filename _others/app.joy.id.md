## Web App Description

**[DOCUMENTATION](https://docs.joyid.dev/guide)**

JOYID is a web app that supports Bitcoin, Bitcoin-lightning as well as other blockchains. It makes use of [FIDO Webauthn](https://webauthn.io/) and a blockchain called Nervos CKB. This allows easy registration, login and also allows the use of hardware authentication devices. 

Their documentation also includes pages-under-construction for native apps and progressive web applications. 

The private key for each chain can be exported. It also allows the backup of a 14-word recovery phrase, however the account must undergo a "Smart Contract Upgrade" payable in 150 $CKDs or roughly $1.68 USD. 

## Analysis

They have 46 repositories in their **[organization page](https://github.com/nervina-labs/)**. 

Based on the available repositories, it appears that JoyID provides several Software Development Kits (SDKs) and integration examples to facilitate interaction with their platform. For instance, the joyid-sdk-js repository offers a JavaScript SDK for developers to integrate JoyID functionalities into their applications. 

However, the repositories primarily contain SDKs and integration tools rather than the complete source code of the JoyID web application itself. The core web app's source code does not seem to be publicly available in these repositories. 

ðŸš© The lack of clarity regarding the lightning network implementation on this app points to the direction of a custodial implementation. Moreover, a 14-word seedphrase is not standard, indicating this app is not compliant with BIP-39 standards.

Add to that the promotional-sounding tone of the [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/lightningnetwork/comments/1i14zd7/just_found_a_new_lightning_wallet/) promoting this app, from a user account with very low karma, leads us to be very wary and skeptical of this app. For now, absent lightning-network implementation documentation, we will classify this app as **custodial**.
