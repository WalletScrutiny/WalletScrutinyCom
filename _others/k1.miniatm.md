### How it works 

Users can buy bitcoin by inserting physical coins in the machine. The user then can receive bitcoin in their wallets by generating a lightning invoice and having the machine scan it. Bitcoins can be transferred via the lightning network.

The machine is not a personal device, and we were not able to find the source code for it.

As the machine is a consumer-facing device made by a company, we have no information how the private keys are generated on the machine.

We will keep this as a work-in-progress until further guidelines are developed for ATMs.
