# Device Description

> All machine identities can be defined via simple DID (decentralized identifiers), but wherever possible they are defined by TA (trust anchors), dedicated hardware components consisting of combination of three functions - a hardware wallet, a data logger and where necessary an energy meter. A machineâ€™s data and metadata are represented as CID (content identifier)

>
> What is the RDDL Network
>
> A revolutionary blockchain-based protocol that offers machines unique, incorruptible identities, enabling them to communicate and transact securely and autonomously.
>
> The RDDL Network interconnects machines & extends them into a new Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN)
>
> With its unique Proof of Productivity (PoP) consensus mechanism, the RDDL Network provides a solution that solves the oracle problem.
