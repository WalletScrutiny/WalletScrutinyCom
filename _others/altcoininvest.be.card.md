## Background

This was a fundraising attempt started by Frederic Exelmans on Kickstarter. The fundraiser was not successful and was suspended by Kickstarter. 

## Product Description 

The public key is in the front-facing portion of the card while the private keys are at the back. Five QR codes representing different keys are on each side of the card. These represent different kinds of cryptocurrencies.

## Analysis 

Since the project was suspended by Kickstarter, this product didn't make production. The domain written in the prototype picture does not generate a response and has no archive entry.
