## Background

> A Woodwallet is a secure mean for storing Bitcoins and other cryptos offline as a physical object. Woodwallets’ underlying principles are the same as traditional paper-wallets : a two-sided wallet card contains a private key (encrypted) on one side and the corresponding public address on the other. The woodwallet also comes with the corresponding QR code engraved so you can scan it with any smartphone/camera.
>
> By shaping wood we provide you with a reliable, unique and durable product that, unlike paper, is designed to last. Perfect to secure your savings offline on something valuable, Woodwallets is also a mean to spread crypto currency. Bring it with you, gift it to a friend, or use it to kick-off conversations.  Show around that crypto currency is not so ‘virtual’ as they might think.
>
> Woodwallets is available in three versions : public address only, private key only, and double side. 

Although the site is still online, the administrator had [this to say](https://woodwallets.io/goodbye-woodwallets/): 

> TL DR; Life got in the way and  we will not able to work on Woodwallets.io with the same level of passion and dedication we used to. Instead of just running it like a boring online shop, we decided to suspend operations. If you happen to know someone who can be interested in picking up the business and run it with passion, Bitcoin accepted.

> ### Why would I trust you with my private key?
>
> You don’t have to trust us since we don’t take your plain private key. We only accept encrypted private keys. This means that your  key is protected by a passphrase and without it there is nothing we can do with it. It will take a state-of-the-art supercomputer million years to crack a decent passphrase.
>
> You can even take a picture of your private side and post-it online if you feel like.
We offer tutorials and an easy-to-use tool to encrypt your keys.

## Analysis 

The private key only and double side versions have a BIP0038 encrypted **private key engraved** on one of the sides. The last twitter [post](https://mobile.twitter.com/woodwallets/status/567681678144188416) was tweeted on August 8, 2015. The user gets to keep the passphrase secret. However, this approach is susceptible to the [$5 wrench attack](https://xkcd.com/538/). Nevertheless, the **provider said goodbye** in 2015, but somehow, the website is still online.
