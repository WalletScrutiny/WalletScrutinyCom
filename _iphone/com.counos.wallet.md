Nothing in the description hints at this app being non-custodial.

On the website
[the section about the mobile wallet](https://www.counos.io/counos-mobile-wallet-tutorial) explains in cumbersome ways how to migrate between security features
but doesn't answer this question neither.

For now we assume this app is custodial and thus **not verifiable**.
