> Security is a critical concern for a cryptocurrency exchange. FTX uses
  industry-leading security solutions built in-house (both online and offline).

"industry-leading" and "built in-house" found in the same sentence is kind of
scary when it doesn't come from the actual industry leader. Either way, the
"online and offline" part sounds very custodial and thus **not verifiable**.
