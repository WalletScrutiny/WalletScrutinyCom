PDAX or the "Philippine Digital Asset Exchange" is a cryptocurrency exchange.

It allows deposits and withdrawals of different cryptocurrency assets only after KYC. 

In its [Terms Page](https://trade.pdax.ph/pages/terms), under Section 17 "Assumption of Risk", it mentions:

> You accept the risks associated with the use of the PDAXâ€™s online Platform and its Services in transacting Digital Assets such as, but not limited to: **Failure of security of your Wallet address and Private Keys;**

We contacted PDAX support and they confirmed that they do not provide the private keys for the wallets.

Verdict is **custodial**
