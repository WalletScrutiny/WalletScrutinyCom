I need not go further into researching this wallet as the statement on the
Google Play description screams custodial.

> We hold your cryptocurrencies in both “cold storage” and “hot wallets”.

This is an exchange trading wallet that holds the customers funds in the
providers control.

Our verdict: This 'wallet' is custodial and therefore is **not verifiable**.
