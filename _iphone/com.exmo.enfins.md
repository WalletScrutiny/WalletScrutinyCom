The Exmo [support FAQ](https://info.exmo.com/en/faq/) states under "Where are my
EXMO funds kept?"

> Users cryptocurrency funds are stored on the exchangeâ€™s crypto wallets: cold
  and hot vaults.

this leads us to conclude the wallet funds are in control of the provider.

Our verdict: This 'wallet' is **not verifiable**.
