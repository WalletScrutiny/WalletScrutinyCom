This wallet claims to be non-custodial but
[went closed-source](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1622)
in early 2016

  No, we moved to closed source to protect the users from getting ripped off by
  scammers. Our website is open source and there are at least 10 clones at the
  time of the writing stealing users' funds (by stealing their private keys).<br>
