This app is not primarily advertised as a wallet. It is an interface to a crypto
exchange but on the App Store description we read:

> Manage your balance and trades on the go so you never miss a market move.
  Deposit and withdraw from your crypto wallet, monitor account balances and
  orders, view real-time ticker updates across all markets, and choose your
  favorite cryptocurrencies and create price alerts for them.

So it has a wallet integrated which is custodial by the sound of it and
therefore **not verifiable**.
