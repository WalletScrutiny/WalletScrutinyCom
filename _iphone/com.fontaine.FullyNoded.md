This is an iOS only app.

## App Description

> Self sovereign, secure, powerful, easy to use wallet that utilizes your own node as a backend. Powered by PSBT's and descriptors. Acts as an offline signer using your node as a watch-only wallet. C-Lightning compatible for instant, unfairly cheap payments.

## Analysis 

With integration to Bitcoin Core and with settings that allow a user to connect to his own node, this app is self-custodial. More information [here](https://fullynoded.app/faq/#How-Do-I-Create-a-Wallet). However, since it is an iOS only app, development relies on mostly proprietary tools. 

We've noted its repository above. 

It is however, **non-verifiable** because of how the Apple App store distributes the app.
