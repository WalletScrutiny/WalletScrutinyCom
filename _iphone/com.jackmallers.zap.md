**Update 2022-04-05**: This app is not available anymore.

This app does not feature a provider website but a GitHub account which links to
[this website](http://zaphq.io).

> **Safe**<br>
  Zap is non-custodial. At no point does anyone have access to funds besides
  you, the user. Your keys, your coins, your node, your rules. All on your
  device.

So we found some code and a claim of not being custodial but the provider does
not claim reproducibility, so we conclude this app is **not verifiable**.
