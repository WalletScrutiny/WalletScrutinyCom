According to
[the words of its owner on 2020-04-12](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/g04ece/bitcoincom_wallet_app_is_still_closed_source/fn7rlvy/)
this wallet is closed source until further notice. There was no indication of a
change by 2020-05-20. We assume it is still
supposed to be non-custodial but without source code, this is **not verifiable**.
