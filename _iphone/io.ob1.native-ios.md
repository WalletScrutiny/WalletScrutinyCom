**Update:** As of now, this app is not to be found on the App Store.

This provider had tweeted us a link to their source code after reviewing the
android version but in the App Store description or their website there is still
no [link to their code](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/haven).

And just like for the Android version, there is no complete build instructions
to reproduce the app. This app is **not verifiable**.
