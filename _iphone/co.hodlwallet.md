On the App Store the provider claims:

> Your Bitcoin are stored on your device and backed up to a Backup Recovery Key
  when you create a wallet. This means HODL Wallet can never stop you from
  accessing or sending your funds.

which is not very clear. The Backup part is a bit concerning but if they had
access to that, the second sentence would be wrong. This should thus be a claim
of being non-custodial.

> HODL Wallet is free, open source

so in their source repository one could check the claim but as iPhone apps are
all currently not reproducible, the app remains **not verifiable**.
