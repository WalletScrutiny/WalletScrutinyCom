Site Description:

> Turkey's Most Trusted Crypto Currency Exchange

Bitay's [Security Policy](https://www.bitay.com/en/security-policy) discusses how its wallets are secured:

> the technology from our trading platform to wallets has been developed within the company in a 100% secure manner. No 3rd party software has been used in case of a security risk. 98% of your platform's crypto-currencies are stored privately in cold wallets that are not connected to the internet.

Bitay also requires [identity verification](https://www.bitay.com/en/how/how-to-do-identity-verification)

The [Support Center > Deposit and Withdraw > Withdraw page](https://www.bitay.com/en/support/deposit-withdraw/withdraw-cryptocurrency-from-bitay) is blank.

However, it has a [status page](https://www.bitay.com/en/status) for the availability of cryptocurrency Withdrawals/Deposits and fees. 

These point to a **custodial** service with an exchange.
