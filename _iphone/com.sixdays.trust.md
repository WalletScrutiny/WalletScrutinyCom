On the App Store they claim:

> Best digital wallet to securely store private keys on your device

While this is not an explicit claim of them not having a copy of those keys, it
is at least strongly implied.

On their website they are more specific:

> **Private & Secure**<br>
  Only you can access your wallet. We don’t collect any personal data.

but as with [their Android app](/android/com.wallet.crypto.trustapp/) there is
no public source of the iPhone app neither.

Without public code the verdict is: **not verifiable**.
