## Analysis 

- We do not have access to a device that supports this app. 
- From the description, the provider states: 

> Synchronize the encrypted asset transaction records of your Touch hardware cold wallet and keep abreast of the latest developments anytime and anywhere. 

Although we have some clues from its wordings, we cannot be certain until we have access to a device that supports this app. We will keep it as a **work-in-progress**.

What we are certain of is that this app is the app on the page of {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/coldlar.ultra' verdict='true' %}.
