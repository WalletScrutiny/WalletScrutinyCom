**Update 2022-01-15**: This app is not on the Store anymore.

Found on their support website...

> The AToken Wallet server does not save any private keys, mnemonics, and
  passwords for users, so mnemonics or lost private keys cannot be retrieved
  from the AToken wallet.<br>
  Please make sure that all users make backups and keep them properly. Do not
  share them with anyone.

The claim on their website is that the wallet is non-custodial, but without source code, this is **not verifiable**.
