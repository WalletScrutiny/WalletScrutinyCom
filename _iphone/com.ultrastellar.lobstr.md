As the description states, lobstr is a stellar lumens wallet. 

However, looking deeper you'll find that you can purchase other assets including bitcoin. You can also add that to the "Assets". 

You need to deposit 5 XLM in order to add the BTC asset.

However, lobstr presumably only holds btc tokens and not actual bitcoin. Hence, the **nobtc** verdict.
