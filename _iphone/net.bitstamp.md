Just like on Play Store {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/net.bitstamp.app' %}, they claim:

> Convenient, but secure<br>
  ‚óè We store 98% of all crypto assets in cold storage

which means you don't get the keys for your coins. This is a custodial service
and therefore **not verifiable**.
