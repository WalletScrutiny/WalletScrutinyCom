Described as a service that provides "over 6 million users with a fast, easy, and secure cryptocurrency exchange experience." 

> Paribu offers 24/7 exchange, deposit, and withdrawal services for all listed cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, even on weekends. 

Given that this app is a cryptocurrency exchange which also offers deposit and withdrawal services, and has no allusions to private keys, it is most likely a custodial offering.

In 8.3. of the Terms and Conditons (had to be run through Google Translate):

> PARIBU detects suspicious transaction attempts in terms of platform workflow and software security, temporarily or permanently close the accounts or accounts of the User to the purchase orders, it has the right to suspend, freeze or temporarily close user accounts performing suspicious transactions. PARIBU forensics/blocking of assets in the user's account due to requests for confiscation (bloke) from judicial and/or administrative authorities and as a result of requests from these authorities to banks/may exercise confiscation (bloke) on behalf of administrative authorities limited to the periods prescribed by law. Due to the application of this article within the framework of honesty and goodwill rules by PARIBU, the legal and criminal responsibility of PARIBU cannot be reached.

This app is **custodial** and as such is not verifiable.
