This provider states in the App Store description:

> Check out the offline device guide on our website.

but forgot to provide a website. We'll go with the one provided for their Android app
{% include walletLink.html wallet='android/org.coinid.vault' %} as there is not much information to
be found on the App Store.

On their code repository we find this:

> Proper readme coming soon.

and this: 

> We are currently not including the secrets.js in the repo.

which means there is no full build instructsions and the app is therefore
**not verifiable**.
