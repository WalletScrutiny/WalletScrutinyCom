Also known as "Alphabit Consulting Pte", it is self-described as an 'Unregulated Platform' in its [Terms](https://abcc.com/en/documents/terms). 

Sections 3.7 and 3.8 of its User Agreements page, procedures regarding the [Deposit/Withdrawal of digital assets](https://abcc.com/en/documents/agreement) indicate that this is a custodial exchange. Withdrawal may take up to 3 to 30 days depending on the site's discretion and AML policy.

This is evidently a **custodial** service that is **not verifiable**
