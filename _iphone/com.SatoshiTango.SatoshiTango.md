> Buy and sell BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP and BCH and monitor your balance and
  transactions.<br>
  Pay in local currency and hold a balance in fiat currency. Store your cryptos
  and much more!

sounds like a wallet that also supports Bitcoin but there is not much
information on who gets to control the keys.

We have to assume this is a custodial offering and thus **not verifiable**.
