**Disclaimer**: The authors of this project have contributed to Mycelium Android.

This app has [public source code](https://github.com/mycelium-com/wallet-ios)
which is independent of their Android version.

The provider claims:

> 100% control over your private keys, they never leave your device unless you
  export them.

but so far nobody reproduced the build, so the claim is **not verifiable**.
