ShapeShift is best known for their non-custodial exchange but this app appears
to be a wallet:

> **STORE YOUR CRYPTO IN A SECURE WALLET**<br>
  Setup a ShapeShift multi-chain wallet in seconds to store your crypto.

... and non-custodial:

> ShapeShift makes self-custody easy, never holding your coins, so you have
  complete control over your assets.

but is their code public? 

On the [referenced website](https://shapeshift.com/) there is no link back to
the app on App Store or Play Store but there is
[this site](https://shapeshift.com/invite) where they suggest having an
invite-only mobile app. When you provide them with your email (Seriously?) they ...
forward you to [this site](https://shapeshift.com/download) where there are
actually download links for both mobile apps.

As we couldn't find any source code we assume the app is closed source and
therefore **not verifiable**.
