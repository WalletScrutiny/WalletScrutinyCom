## App Description

> This is not a wallet, only a key manager. You’ll use Bitcoin Core to download and verify the blockchain, track your wallet balance, craft a transaction, estimate the perfect fee and broadcast it to the network once you’ve signed.
>
> Because some of this functionality is a bit tedious in Bitcoin Core, we recommend using the Specter Desktop application to make the entire process straight forward.

## Analysis 

This app is no longer available in the app store and as described by the provider, is **not a wallet**.
