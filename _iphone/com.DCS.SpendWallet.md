No statements regarding private key managment can be found on the [providers website](https://www.spend.com/app) or [Support section](https://help.spend.com).
It would be prudent to assume the private keys are under the control of the provider.

Our verdict: This 'wallet' is custodial and therefore is **not verifiable**.
