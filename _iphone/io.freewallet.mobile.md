**Update 2022-01-04**: The iOS version of the app is available again. [(Twitter Screenshot)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1478292560443367427). The last update however was 2019-03-18.

**Update 2021-10-12**: This app is not available anymore.

In the description we can read:

> Secure<br>
  Wallet Passphrase & private keys never leave device

and

> FreeWallet is an open source mobile wallet which supports Bitcoin.

so it's a non-custodial, open source Bitcoin wallet but can we verify the
claims?

On their website we find a link to their GitHub and from their to the mobile
wallet's repository. There we find no claims of reproducibility and not even
build instructions, so this app is **not verifiable**.
