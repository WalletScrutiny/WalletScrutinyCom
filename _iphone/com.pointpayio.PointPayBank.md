The PointPay Bank website has very little information about how they manage
private keys of the users.
The only basic statement is...

> We use strong military-grade encryption to store private keys

we will have to conclude the wallet funds are in control of the provider and
hence custodial.

Our verdict: This 'wallet' is custodial and therefore is **not verifiable**.
