From the App Store description it clearly states the private keys are in control
of the provider:

> Also, 98% of all cryptocurrencies on Quidax are stored in cold wallets
  (offline) with the remaining 2% protected in line with security best
  practises.

This means the exchange is holding the bitcoins on behalf of the user, hence
custodial.

Our verdict: This 'wallet' is custodial and therefore **not verifiable**.
