**Update 2022-02-02**: This app is not in store anymore.

**Update 2022-01-05**: The iOS app is accessible again. [(See Twitter Screenshot)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1478681726423470083)

**Update 2021-08-28**: This app is no more.

From the App Store description it clearly states the private keys are in control
of the provider:

> Also, 98% of all cryptocurrencies on Quidax are stored in cold wallets
  (offline) with the remaining 2% protected in line with security best
  practises.

This means the exchange is holding the bitcoins on behalf of the user, hence
custodial.

Our verdict: This 'wallet' is custodial and therefore **not verifiable**.
