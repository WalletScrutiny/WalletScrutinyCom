The CoinZoom [support FAQ](https://www.coinzoom.com/support/) states the wallet
is custodial... 

Found under "Where can I find the private keys for my wallet?":

> As CoinZoom is a hosted wallet, it's not feasible to provide the private keys
  to individual wallet addresses; doing so would prevent us from taking
  advantage of our secure cold-storage technology to protect your funds.

this leads us to conclude the wallet funds are in control of the provider.

Our verdict: This 'wallet' is custodial and therefore **not verifiable**.
