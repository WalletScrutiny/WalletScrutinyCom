**Update 2021-07-26**: As it turns out, the provider has limited the
availability of the app to fewer countries and excluded the US, Chile and some
more that we had tested for.

**Update 2021-07-26**: This app is not available on the App Store since one week
and we suspect it might not come back. We sent a DM to their Twitter that is
active every day a week ago but got no reply. Their Play Store version is still
available, with borderline ratings: Many unhappy customers but scam accusations
are not dominating the 1* ratings.

The Yellow Card wallet has no statements on
[their website](https://yellowcard.io/) or in their FAQ regarding the management
of private keys.
This leads us to conclude the wallet funds are likely under the control of the
provider and hence custodial.

Our verdict: This 'wallet' is **not verifiable**.
