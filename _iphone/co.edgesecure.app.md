On the App Store the provider claims:

> Edge is a powerful and easy to use cryptocurrency wallet that allows users to
  easily control their own private keys with the familiarity and ease of mobile banking. 

and

> The Edge app has open-source code to ensure the highest level of security and
  privacy.

and indeed on their website we find a link to GitHub and assume
[this](https://github.com/EdgeApp/edge-react-gui) is the app's repository.

Unfortunately apps on iPhone can't be reproduced so far, so the app is
**not verifiable**.
