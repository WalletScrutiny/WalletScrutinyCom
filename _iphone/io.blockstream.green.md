The description in the App Store is not explicit about the app being
non-custodial and on their website we read:

> **Unmatched Security**<br>
  Our innovative multisignature model uses dual private keys - one held by the
  user, and one by our servers. This allows us to enforce Two-Factor
  Authentication to protect your funds, while timelock smart contracts guarantee
  that users always retain full control of their coins.

This model never puts the provider in a position of being able to spend the
user's coins but the user cannot spend the coins neither until a predefined
time elapsed, should their servers not cooperate.

While not uncontroversial, this is not custodial
but so far nobody reproduced the build, so claims about security are
**not verifiable**.
