**Update 2022-01-04**: This app is available once more in the iOS app store. The app was last updated 2021-07-21

**Update 2021-10-14**: This app is no more available.

The website states:

> The majority of our users’ Bitcoins are kept securely in cold storage. This is
  equivalent to a digital bank vault.

this leads us to conclude the wallet funds are in control of the provider and
hence custodial.

Our verdict: This 'wallet' is custodial and therefore is **not verifiable**.
