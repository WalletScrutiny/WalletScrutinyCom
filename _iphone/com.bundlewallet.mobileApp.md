**Update 2021-08-31**: This app is no more available.

The [Bundle website](https://bundle.africa/) claims to be a wallet from their description...

> Send, receive, request naria and other ctyptocurrenices for free.

so it claims to manage BTC, however their is no evidence of the wallet being non-custodial, with no source code repository listed or found...

Our verdict: This 'wallet' is probably custodial but does not provide public source and therefore is **not verifiable**.
