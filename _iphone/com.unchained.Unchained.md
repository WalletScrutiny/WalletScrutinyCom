## App Description from the App Store

> Most bitcoin IRA providers require that you give up control of your bitcoin. This exposes you to the risk of exchange hacks, frozen accounts, and other third-party risks. With an Unchained IRA, you get peace of mind by controlling the keys to your bitcoin.

        I've been a long-term user of Unchained because of their superior security and service but I did sometimes feel limited by not being able to access my account on my phone. I'm glad Unchained has finally launched a mobile app! Not all features of the website are available in the mobile app (yet?) but it's slick and easy to use and I can check balances and buy bitcoin. Highly recommend that other Unchained clients check out the app.

        Very clean app - meticulously designed for the cleanest UX to track your portfolio, view products, deposit, and trade on the go. Buying directly to cold storage from a mobile app is surreal.
        The Unchained app doesn't yet do everything a mobile wallet app might, but it does an amazing job with the core feature set. This will grow into something truly special.
        If you're not an Unchained client, you probably should be. Hold your own keys and protect your bitcoin wealth with the help of industry experts!

## Analysis 

This app serves as the mobile balance checker and a buying tool. It allows the user to purchase Bitcoin to an address/private key the user controls. This is **not a wallet by itself**.
