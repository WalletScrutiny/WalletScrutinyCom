Etoro is used to speculate on assets more than to actually transfer them but in
the case of Bitcoin, according to
[the Help Center](https://www.etoro.com/customer-service/help/1422157482/can-i-withdraw-my-cryptocurrencies-from-the-platform/)
you can actually send Bitcoins from this app ... if you are in the right
jurisdiction ...
[further restrictions apply](https://etoro.nanorep.co/widget/widget.html?kb=156763&account=etoro#onloadquestionid=1306615492) ...

So all in all this could pass as a custodial app.

As a custodial app it is **not verifiable**.
