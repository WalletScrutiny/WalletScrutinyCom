bitFlyer is **custodial** and **not verifiable.**

As an additional note, some users on Play Store seemed to have problems with verification.

 I cannot verify my bank details, I have submitted my all the bank details clearly but they closed my account without giving the proper reason. But I am still trying to create, And also I cannot connect the Custom care number. I have tried many times but still cannot.

I gave 1 star only because there is no 0 star option. One word, meh. Verification is slow and difficult, the flexibility of the app and platform needs a lot of work. Why use this when you got siperior alternatives. (this is not a question)
