The CEX.io mobile app claims on the website to manage bitcoins...

> Stay in control of your funds anywhere. Deposit and withdraw crypto and fiat, add your debit or credit card in a few clicks, and store your funds securely.

however their is no evidence of the wallet being non-custodial, with no source code repository listed or found...

Our verdict: This 'wallet' is probably custodial but does not provide public source and therefore is **not verifiable**.
