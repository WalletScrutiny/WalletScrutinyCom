**Update 2021-06-16**: It's been a few days this app is not on the App store
anymore and it looks like it's not coming back. If it should return, please open
an issue on our issue tracker!

Just like for the Play Store version, the App Store wallet is not open source.
The provider only shares some of the code they presumably use in the app, with
no way of even proving this. The app is **not verifiable**.
