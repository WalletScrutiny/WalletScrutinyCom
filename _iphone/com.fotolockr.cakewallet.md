**Update 2021-04-14**: They now do have a public issue tracker and
[emanuel](/authors/emanuel) tried to build with
[slightly more success](https://github.com/cake-tech/cake_wallet/issues/112)
but the verdict remains the same.

> Cake Wallet allows you to safely store, send receive and exchange your XMR /
  Monero and BTC / Bitcoin.

is an implicit claim of this being a non-custodial Bitcoin wallet but:

> -You control your own seed and keys

is more explicit about the non-custodial part.

On their website we read:

> **FEATURES**<br>
  ...<br>
  Open source

and indeed, there is [a source code repo](https://github.com/cake-tech/cake_wallet).

There is no claim about reproducibility or build instructions. As the app uses
[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and we have no experience with that, we have to
stop here. Usually at this point we open issues on the code repository but they
have no public issue tracker.
