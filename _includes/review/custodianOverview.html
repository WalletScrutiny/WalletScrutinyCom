  <h2>Custodian Scrutiny</h2>
  <p>We conduct a comprehensive analysis of bitcoin custodians across multiple critical dimensions. Our evaluation examines their security infrastructure (hot/cold storage design, proof of reserves), operational focus (bitcoin-only vs multi-coin), business practices (leadership, jurisdiction, track record), ecosystem contributions (FOSS development, protocol adoption), and user protection measures (KYC requirements, security features, custody model). This thorough assessment helps users make informed decisions about which custodians best align with their security needs and bitcoin values.</p>
