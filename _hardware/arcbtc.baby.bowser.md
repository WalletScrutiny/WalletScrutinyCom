## Product Description 

> This very cheap off the shelf hardware wallet is designed to work with Lilygos Tdisplay, but you can easily make work with any ESP32.
> 
> Data is sent to/from BabyBowser over webdev Serial, not the most secure data transmission method, but fine for handling small-medium sized amounts of funds. You can use LNbits OnchainWallet extension, or any other serial monitor.

## Analysis 

Documentation is very sparse for this device. 

Not to be mistaken for its bigger counterpart {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/bowser' verdict='true' %}, this bitcoin hardware wallet is  a **do-it-yourself project**.
