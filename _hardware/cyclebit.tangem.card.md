## Product Description 

> Cycle Card is a 'cold storage' wallet with high-grade hardware protection, developed by Tangem. Non-retrievable private keys prohibit the replication of the card and assets stored on it

> Each Cycle Card is bound to a one-off depersonalized wallet address on the blockchain without any personal accounts or private servers. Backed by 100% uptime and an unblockable P2P network of all blockchain nodes.

It can be paired with the Cycle Wallet which is available in [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.cyclebit.wallet) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cycle-wallet/id1533957295)

## Analysis 

This is a Tangem branded offering which can be used by retailers together with [Cyclebit's point of sale](https://www.cyclebit.io/pos) solution. Just like other Tangem products listed above, **the card does not have a display or an interface.**
