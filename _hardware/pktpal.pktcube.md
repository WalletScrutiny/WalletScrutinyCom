## Analysis

> **What is PKT?**
>
> PKT allows users to monetize their unused internet bandwidth. By participating in the PKT Network you are helping to build a faster, stronger, and more secure, decentralized network.
>
> Turn your unused Internet into PKT Cash
> PKT Cash is a fully decentralized cryptocurrency that is paid every 60 seconds when connecting your PKT Cube to the PKT Network.
>
> **How do I buy or sell PKT?**
>
> PKT is currently listed on Bittrex Global (non-US) and Bitmart (US/Global). You can send your coins from your PKT Cube to the exchange or buy PKT from the exchange and transfer them to your PKT Wallet on your PKT Cube.

It's stated that the users can both send out and receive coins from the PKT wallet "on the cube." While this may qualify this product as a hardware wallet, it certainly **does not qualify as a bitcoin wallet.**
