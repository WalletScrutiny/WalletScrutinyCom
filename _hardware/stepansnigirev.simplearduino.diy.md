## Background 

The {{ page.title }} may be the predecessor to the {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/stepansnigirev.microbitcoin.arduino.diy' verdict='true' %}

From the [Simple Hardware Wallet page:](https://github.com/arduino-bitcoin/simple_hardware_wallet) 

> A minimalistic hardware wallet working with electrum transactions.
>
> This sketch is a simple demo that shows how to use arduino-bitcoin library to build your own hardware wallet.
>
> It should be used only for educational or testing purposes as default Arduino boards are not secure, their firmware can be updated from the computer and this process doesn't require any user interaction.

>- Adafruit M0 Adalogger board with SD card
- Adafruit OLED screen
- Headers
- Soldering station to solder the headers and pins
