## Background 

OTON is a project primarily centered on the "OTON ecosystem" which is directed to affiliate marketing and multilevel marketing. They also have an ERC-20 token by the same name, [(OTON - Optimal Trade Over Network)](https://etherscan.io/token/0x25bae8f104d364fd2c7510e17bb3a8f8b845dd6c). 

It is primarily marketed to the Eastern European markets, specifically Russia. Information about the hardware wallet has been difficult to find. There were no Youtube videos and reverse image searches yielded results similar to "home security systems". 

The project also has three primary domains: oton.technology, oton.market and oton.org. All have the same logos and started having activity similar to each other sometime in 2020.

## Product Description 

There are some documents that were cached by Google Cache, but otherwise are not available to download by clicking directly: 

- [OTON Wallet Pre-Order Terms and Conditions](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:frRhJUd5OVAJ:https://wallet.oton.technology/docs/pre-order-terms-and-conditions.pdf)

- [OTON Terms and Conditions](https://www.oton.technology/OtonTechnology_TermsAndConditions.pdf)

- [OTON Whitepaper](https://oton.technology/oton-whitepaper-en.pdf)

Of these, the Pre-Order Terms and Conditions offer clues about the device: 

> These Pre-Order Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern the placing of pre-orders ("Pre-Order") for OTON Wallet («Product») that will be ready for delivery starting from the firstquarter of 2022 («Release Date»). Please read these Terms carefully before submittingyour Pre-Order. By submitting your Pre-Order, you agree to be legally bound by these

The wallet is purchased with the OTON tokens:

> Pre-order of certain types of OTON Wallets also includes sale of OTON Tokens. Such saleof OTON Tokens will be governed by the Terms and Conditions of OTON Token sale

We were able to log-on to oton.org, but the site immediately asked for KYC verification. 

The option 'Buy Tokens' redirects to pancakeswap's Optimal Trade Over Network page.

Information from the oton.club domain: 

> The OTON hardware wallet is based on the open source code of the well-known manufacturer of similar devices Trezor, which is a recognized standard in terms of security and convenience. It is not only about the software, but also about the hardware (STM32 chip is used).
>
> The wallet is multi-currency, that is, it allows, in addition to OTON tokens, to safely store a wide range of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin (BTC) and Binance Smart Chain tokens (BEP20).
> 
> The device has a three-layer physical access tamper protection system. This system allows you to completely prevent the main attack vector, in which the attacker seeks to gain access to the memory of the device.
>
> Thus, OTON wallet can be rightfully called technological and safe. It would seem, what more could one want?
>
> A Wallet that earns.
> 
> The OTON hardware wallet has its own economic model. The thing is that the device is sold with OTON tokens frozen in it, which are unfrozen in equal portions every 10 seconds for 5 years due to the operation of a special smart contract.
> 
> The first buyers of the wallet will be active ecosystem users interested in owning OTON tokens and using them in their daily activities.
>
> The ecosystem also allows you to do the seemingly impossible: restore the hardware wallet in case of its physical loss or damage. For this purpose, there is a unique procedure of private key recovery based on mandatory verification of all OTON users.

## Analysis 

The operators of OTON seems to cover their hardware wallet with various legal conditions and KYC verification. Even the pre-order process has a Terms and Conditions agreement the user has to agree to. 

Suffice to say, to be able to get more information about their device, you'd have to 1. actually buy it first, 2. agree to their terms and conditions, and 3. pass through their KYC verification. 

If we are to believe their own claims, here's a brief summary: 

- It is a multi-currency wallet based off the Trezor firmware
- It unlocks features of the "OTON ecosystem" 

The pre-order terms and conditions state that the {{ page.title }} hardware wallets are due for release in the first quarter of 2022. Though that time has passed, there were provisions that allow OTON to extend that release date. Until such time that further information is available, we'll tag this device as **not yet released.**
