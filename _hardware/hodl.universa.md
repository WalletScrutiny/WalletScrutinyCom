## Background 

On February 26, 2018, a Medium article announced the {{ page.title }} hardware wallet was available for pre-order. It claimed the device could support Bitcoin, ERC20 compatible tokens, and Universa tokens. It was meant to connect to the user's phone via Bluetooth and had an OLED display for confirming transactions.

Clicking the links to the [pre-order page](https://hodl.universablockchain.com) of universa on redirects to a site that is no longer available. Furthermore, Universa Blockchain has ceased to mention the hardware wallet in any of its publicity materials.

## Analysis 

Universa's Twitter account has last seen activity in 2021, but there was nothing related to this wallet. 

As information is scarce and outdated, we have to assume that this product is abandoned or defunct. As such, it qualifies as **vaporware.**
