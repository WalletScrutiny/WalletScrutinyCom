Announced on [twitter on May 17, 2020](https://twitter.com/Starteosio/status/1129233526597902336), it was difficult to find technical information, documentation, reviews and video reviews of the product. It does however have some Chinese language videos from its official YouTube channel:

From what we can see, the device does not have a display. 

- Multi-chain support - Maximum 500+ multi-chain wallet with safe storage
- Double backup - Two-way backup stored in SD card, safe and stable
- High-speed transmission - Bluetooth high-speed connection, one-click synchronization

It is also apparently paired with

However, going over the StartEOS Memory Box 2 page, it would seem that the Start App is now supposed to be [downloaded from their own servers](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1466371607396421633).

## Private keys can be created offline - ❓

From this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AerkoPsMBFk), it would seem that the Memory Box serves more as a BlueTooth enabled device to back up the StartEOS wallet.

The StartEOS [help files](https://www.starteos.io/en/help/) redirect to another domain, yuque.com. It is a Chinese language site. 

## Private keys are not shared - ✔️

From Yuque.com, we have some clues on how the Memory Box handles [private keys](https://www.yuque.com/books/share/c9d238e5-b27d-4386-a36e-01fd18f181f9/ftfr65):

> 友情提示：Start开发的Memory Box硬件钱包，它将私钥单独存储在一个安全芯片中，与网络彻底隔离。因其不触网，从而杜绝了一切网络黑客入侵方式，是目前最安全的钱包之一。

Translated via Google Translate:

> Friendly reminder: The Memory Box hardware wallet developed by Start stores the private key separately in a security chip, which is completely isolated from the network. Because it does not touch the Internet, it eliminates all methods of network hacking, and it is one of the most secure wallets at present.


## Device displays receive address for confirmation - ❌

The device does not have a display.

## Verdict

This device has no display from which the user can interface with. It can only be paired with an app with an APK downloadable through the StartEOS website.
