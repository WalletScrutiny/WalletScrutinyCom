**⚠️ Warning:** There are some third-party websites that have raised red flags concerning this product/project. We would not be linking to them as they have received adverse reactions from the project creators by filing copyright claims against their hosting provider. We leave that for you to Google.

## Product Information 

The Zeniq Hub is basically a tablet with pre-installed software, which includes masternode functionality. We assume that it's the {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.zeniq.wallet' verdict='true' %}.

The project mentions "tokenized fundraising" on its homepage:

> Through "Tokenized Fundraising" (token-based capital raising), which is comparable to "Initial Coin Offerings" (ICOs), start-ups have been able to raise billions of Euros / Dollars in recent years.

The project mentions the Zeniq Safir Hub as a hardware wallet.

There is an ERC20 token with the same name, the Zeniq Coin. 

It says on their website that the Zeniq Hub can issue coins:

> Issuing through mining (1%) and minting (99%) on the ZENIQ HUB only
>
> The ZENIQ coin can be used as a platform for tokens e.g. for customers in profit-sharing projects, physical assets (e.g. objects of art, precious metals, real estate) and much more

It was hard to gather technical information about the device itself since much of the service is bundled in marketing speak. 

The tablet is described as having a: 

> - 7-inch HD touch screen
> - 2 GHz with 6 core processors
> - 200+ GB memory
> - Portal for digital investments
> - Direct access to the decentralized ZENIQ Exchange
> - No KYC required
> - Each Zeniq Hub is a Zeniq masternode
> - Mints Zeniq coins on a daily basis
> - Generate IBAN yourself

## Analysis 

Since we cannot find any specifications for the device, we can only infer from the information that we were able to find publicly. Most of their material is marketing oriented. 

Note that several domain names have been registered which possesses the project's likeness.

We assume that the Zeniq app is installed on the tablet. IF this is true, then we would have to assess the Android app. 

We installed the {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.zeniq.wallet' %}

It is a multi-currency app, with Bitcoin send and receive support. 

There is also an option for backing up via 12-words. 

There is no reference to the project being an Open Source project and **we could not find any links to a publicly available source code**.
