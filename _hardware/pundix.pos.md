The Pundi X Point-of-Sale system is a device for merchants to accept payments and sell cryptocurrencies. The device can accept payments from the Pundi X Pass card or the Pundi X wallet app. It supports the following cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, XEM, XLM, QTUM, PXS and others. It was [announced in 2020](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paypal-to-be-available-on-pundi-xs-blockchain-based-pos-devices-301085940.html) that the device will also be supporting PayPal payments.

## Product Description

The hardware specifications are:

> Pundi X POS employs an Android-based software with enhanced security for its operating system, designed to support blockchain applications such as cryptocurrency wallets and secure exchange platforms. As for the user interface (UI), a separate article will be published to introduce the main functions of the device menu.
>
> A robust device, XPOS includes a MTK8735 quad-core (1.3GHz) ARM Cortex processor, 1G RAM, 8G ROM, and a dedicated safety CPU module (Megahunt Micro 1901C). Not every POS device has customizable memory, however, Pundi X POS comes with a 2G (RAM) + 16G ROM variant. The storage capacity of the device is 4.11GB.
>
> Magnetic stripe, contact & non-contact card readers
> Unlike other traditional POS systems, Pundi X POS offers a variety of compatible hardware including magnetic stripe reader, contact & non-contact IC readers, PSAM reader, SIM/UID reader, and TF reader.
>
> It also comes equipped with a 5MP AF rear camera (with flash) to scan barcodes and take photos for KYC registration when activating the crypto card, thermal printer (it prints QR, barcodes, ASCII, and customizable text for advertisement on the receipt), I/O ports, as well as built-in mic and speaker.

## Analysis

Pundi X's [whitepaper](https://pundix.com/pdf/PundiX_Whitepaper_EN_Ver.pdf) references a software and hardware 'Reference Implementation Stack' called the Pundi X Platform. Although they claim that some parts of the project are Open Source, we are not able to find a repository specifically pointing for the Pundi X PoS. 

Although it [supports certain functions of a cryptocurrency wallet](https://pundix.com/product/), Pundi XPoS is primarily used as a merchant device for collecting payments.
