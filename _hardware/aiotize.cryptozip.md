## Background 

The device has a stark resemblance with the {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/seedsigner' verdict='true' %}. 

The components are generally similar save for the USB plug. 

They claim to be Open Source but we were not able to locate their repository and binaries. 

## Analysis 

Absent links to a repository, binaries, detailed specification sheet, functions, or even a description of how it works, we believe this to be a copy of a **do-it-yourself project** that's **closed source**. We [asked for more information](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1522780050822950913) on twitter and this is their response:
