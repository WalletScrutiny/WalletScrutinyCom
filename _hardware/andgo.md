## 2022-02-18

The homepage is now online again. However, we were not able to find anything specific about the hardware wallet:

> The hardware wallet is a dedicated hardware that acts as a "deposit account" and is characterized by storing and managing the "private key" offline. By storing the private key in a place that is not directly accessible over the Internet, the risk of hacking is reduced and security is increased.
>
> However, the existing hardware wallet had the trouble of management and operation including erroneous remittance due to operation error and backup.
>
> Excellent safety created by AndGo
>
> We scrutinized the design of the hardware wallet from scratch and developed it independently with the aim of eliminating the hassle of daily operations. By vertically integrating this device with software technology similar to layered security as a signature key management solution, we have achieved a high level of security and simple operability.

## More information

We got this information from a [Medium Post](https://medium.com/tokyo-fintech/made-in-japan-andgo-hardware-wallet-9eb2042b4c4f) written by Norbert Gehke:

> The device will be available for pre-order in early 2019, and the first batch is expected to be released during the April timeframe.

> - Out-of-Box Multisig
> - Biometric Authentication
> - AEAD Ciphers
> - Multi-factor Authentication
> - Traceability

> Authentication between devices can be contactless, deposits/withdrawals are affected by QR code, and there is no need to enter an address or a password each time. Since the wallet uses the smart phone as the interface, it provides an excellent user experience. Users will be able to manage their own virtual currency assets themselves more securely and easily.

> In addition, AndGo is looking to provide for recoverability of pass (or mnemonic) phrases through an additional subscription-based service, “AndGo Safety Net”. This service will require full customer identification through a standard KYC (Know-Your-Customer) process.

Since then, we tried to contact them again via [twitter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1494563582058450946) but have still to receive a response. 

The blog post noted that it will be available for pre-order in early 2019. It is already 2022. Until we receive further information or a reply, this hardware wallet will retain its former status.

## Previous Analysis

## Advertised features

> - A large display screen

The device can be paired with a phone using Bluetooth. Multiple backup options were also presented. 

## Verdict

The ANDGO bitcoin hardware wallet isn't currently available in the market. We [reached out to them via twitter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1485890405921337344) to ask them about their product but didn't get a reply in weeks. Until new information is made available we assume this product is not released yet.
