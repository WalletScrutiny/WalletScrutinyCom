## Update 2024-10-22

The US DOJ has recently indicted the CEO Manpreet Kohli aka "Mkay" for fraud and market manipulation. Despite overtures on social media, that they are close to having a product, this seems very unlikely now. A verdict of **vaporware** is appropriate.

## Background 2022-05-03

Saitama Token is an ERC20 token launched in June 2021. Although the {{ page.title }} has been mentioned on social media, there are no hardware specifications and no clear technical descriptions of it yet. Given the token of the same name [lost 97% of its peak value](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/saitama-inu), we assume this project also is not going to materialize and thus is **vaporware**.
