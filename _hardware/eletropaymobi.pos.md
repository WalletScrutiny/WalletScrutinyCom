## Product Description

EletroPay is a Point of Sale provider that's originally described as having offices in China. Later on, their social media pivoted to EletroPay Europa which is based in Lichtenstein. The point of sale system has two basic components, the PoS device and the EletroPay card. Their user base are commercial entities that wish to use a cryptocurrency payment solution. 

Their homepage is currently suspended but their [store is still online](https://store-eletropay.ecwid.com/). Their social media accounts' have last posted in 2021. 

## Analysis  

The Eletro Point of Sale system claims to support other electronic payment options and thus would need an Internet connection. They **cannot be classified as hardware wallets** because they were not specifically designed for offline wallet creation or the secure airgapping of Bitcoin private keys.
