The now unavailable IndieGogo page for this product stated:

> "OraSaifu: First All In One Smart Wallet" is under review. It is not accepting contributions.

[Here](https://web.archive.org/web/20190117180758/https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/orasaifu-first-all-in-one-smart-wallet#/) is a link to an archived version of its page.

[Orasaifu.io](https://www.orasaifu.io/) is also down.

A [Reddit post from April 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/bh6u0k/indiegogo_project_refunded_their_backers_in/) stated that OraSaifu was planning on refunding their backers with BTC as the project had failed.

The author of the post claimed that:

> They wrote: We have to stop our project, our project will go to “hibernate”.
>
> And they said at one point that they will refund everybody.

There are many scam accusations on the comments of OraSaifu's social media pages, with many backers saying that they still had not received a refund. [A poster on BitcoinTalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5170463.0) reported this same problem and attached a few images of the refund statement. The original thread was created in July 2019, although the original poster updated the thread during November 2019, and said that the money had never returned.
