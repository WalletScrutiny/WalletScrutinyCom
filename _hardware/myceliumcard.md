Since the product is **unreleased**, specifications were hard to come by. [Video presentation](https://vimeo.com/145770131) of the card was last made on November 15, 2015.

## What we do know

The card made use of colored coins as tokens pegged to fiat currency. It also made use of mesh networks and ISM radio frequencies.

> Mycelium does not use any cryptocurrencies for payments. It uses digital tokens that can be passed over the Blockchain from one node to another in a secure, fast, and inexpensive manner. Each type of unit is backed up by the legal promise of an issuing institution just like any fiat currency or legacy-protected asset would be.

The card is linked to {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.mycelium.wallet' verdict='true' %}

As there were no updates on the product in many years, we consider it to be
defunct.
