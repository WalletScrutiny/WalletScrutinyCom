## Product Description 

The product tried to raise funds via [indiegogo.com](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/prismicide-world-s-most-secure-bitcoin-hardware-wallet-and-anti-prism-platform#/) in 2014 which did not meet its funding goals. It then rebranded to Bitcoinpinpad.com, and the device was slightly altered but this too was discontinued. As PRISMicide, it was described as:

> PRISMicide is an open security platform based on smart card (www.origamiboard.com) and by far the most secure Bitcoin Hardware Wallet

It is comprised of two components: an Open Source smart card and an "open hardware" portable player or reader. The smart card protects the private keys. The portable player can interface with Android and iOS devices, or with Windows, Mac or Linux systems via USB. In order to sign transactions, the user must key in a pin code to allow the portable player to display transaction details through its display. The card utilizes an HD BIP32-compliant seed. The user can back up the seed phrases and regenerate the private keys should the need arise. The reader displays this on the screen. 

It also has multisig support: 

> P2SH addresses can be generated on the PRISMicide terminal by inserting several cards and choose the required cooperation "2 of 2", "2 of 3" and "3 of 3". Then you can unlock funds sent to this address by inserting the right number of cards depending on the chosen escrow model to sign the transaction.

## Verdict 

The defunct project claims to be Open Source, however since most of the possible sources for information about their code are also gone, we believe that the project's code is no longer publicly available. We asked on twitter to verify for [documentation purposes](https://mobile.twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1506181236221710342).
