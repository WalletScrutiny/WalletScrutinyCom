## Background Information 

The project has recently undergone some changes in branding and its 'team'. Its twitter presence is now known as Hydranet. Previously, the project primarily centers on Stakenet, a masternode based cryptocurrency with claims of Lightning network interoperability. 

## Device Information 

The Stakenet project [described](https://twitter.com/TheHydranet/status/1088401906341462017?lang=da) the XSN Viper as a "hardware Lightning router". 

A [bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5156157.0) announcement page for XSN described it as:

> Stakenet is supported by Ledger, Xeeda, And Trezor - However they are building their own hardware wallet from scratch, which will be a competitor to these 3. This is the first blockchain project world wide to actually make their own hardware wallet, which is pretty cool. Debut product from XSN Hardware division - a hardware Lightning router that allows users to set up Lightning Network hubs for XSN, BTC, LTC, and collect fees while their private keys remain safe and secure in cold storage.

There are no further updates about the hardware wallet beyond 2019. 

We believe that the XSN Viper hardware wallet will not be in production anytime soon.
