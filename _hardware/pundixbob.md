## Update 2024-10-22

Although the company Pundi X Labs seems to still be active on social media,

we haven't gotten new information about the {{ page.title }}. So we asked the developers if there's new information. 

Until further developments, we'll start marking this device as **vaporware**

## Product Description 2022-03-23

The Blok On Blok (BOB) smartphone was advertised as being "fully decentralized and operating on the Function X blockchain." It [started its Indiegogo campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bob-world-s-1st-blockchain-phone#/) on January 7, 2020. As of this date, the campaign is closed.

From the description:

> Reclaim your data privacy. Call, text & browse securely. With BOB, regain control & own your data.

It's unclear if this product is meant to be a hardware wallet as there is more information about its features as a smartphone powered by "blockchain tech."

From the Indiegogo page's FAQ, we get more information on the product:

> **How is BOB different from the other existing blockchain phones in the market?**
>
> BOB is the first smartphone that is powered by blockchain tech allowing users to make calls, send messages, share files and browse the web without a centralized service provider.

Other claims include that it uses the Function X OS, "a dual-mode open-source OS running both Android 9.0 and Blockchain mode in parallel." Users would have been able to switch between the traditional Android mode to Blockchain mode.

The phone also requires a wifi connection or cellular network data to access "the decentralized ecosystem."

> Once a wifi connection (or a cellular network data) is made, the Function X OS will be able to bypass all centralized service provider within its 'Blockchain" mode, offering users the ability to control their data.

PundiX [has a Medium article](https://morningtick.com/news/pundi-x-unveils-bob-worlds-first-blockchain-smartphone/) with a few details concerning the product.

> The smartphone runs on the Android 9 Pie version and offers all the functions of a regular android phone. Powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 chipset, Adreno 512 GPU and 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage, and the storage can be expanded to 512GB.
>
> Other features of the phone include a 4.97-inch AMOLED screen with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and an aspect ratio of 16:9. It has a 48MP primary camera and a front-facing camera of 16MP. The battery is 3300mAh and has a dual nano sim card port, 3.5mm headphone jack, Bluetooth, and NFC.
>
> It is a modular phone, and the users can customize it according to their taste. The BOB is shipped with a MOD kit containing standard components for assembly, and also, the users can purchase additional components. BOB smartphone is available for pre-order on Xwallet and Kickstarter with a retail price of $599.


## Verdict

While there have been working demos featured in videos, there is currently no way to buy this product. PundiX has made a few updates on the IndieGogo page where they mention the delay and uncertainty regarding the phone's production and delivery. They have also offered refunds to backers.

Until further update, this product is marked as **unreleased.**
