## Product Description

The Blok On Blok (BOB) smartphone was advertised as being "fully decentralized and operating on the Function X blockchain." It [started its Indiegogo campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bob-world-s-1st-blockchain-phone#/) on January 7, 2020. As of this date, the campaign is closed.

From the description:

> Reclaim your data privacy. Call, text & browse securely. With BOB, regain control & own your data.

It's unclear if this product is meant to be a hardware wallet as there is more information about its features as a smartphone powered by "blockchain tech."

From the Indiegogo page's FAQ, we get more information on the product:

> **How is BOB different from the other existing blockchain phones in the market?**
>
> BOB is the first smartphone that is powered by blockchain tech allowing users to make calls, send messages, share files and browse the web without a centralized service provider.

Other claims include that it uses the Function X OS, "a dual-mode open-source OS running both Android 9.0 and Blockchain mode in parallel." Users would have been able to switch between the traditional Android mode to Blockchain mode.

The phone also requires a wifi connection or cellular network data to access "the decentralized ecosystem."

> Once a wifi connection (or a cellular network data) is made, the Function X OS will be able to bypass all centralized service provider within its 'Blockchain" mode, offering users the ability to control their data.

PundiX [has a Medium article](https://morningtick.com/news/pundi-x-unveils-bob-worlds-first-blockchain-smartphone/) with a few details concerning the product.

> The smartphone runs on the Android 9 Pie version and offers all the functions of a regular android phone. Powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 chipset, Adreno 512 GPU and 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage, and the storage can be expanded to 512GB.
>
> Other features of the phone include a 4.97-inch AMOLED screen with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and an aspect ratio of 16:9. It has a 48MP primary camera and a front-facing camera of 16MP. The battery is 3300mAh and has a dual nano sim card port, 3.5mm headphone jack, Bluetooth, and NFC.
>
> It is a modular phone, and the users can customize it according to their taste. The BOB is shipped with a MOD kit containing standard components for assembly, and also, the users can purchase additional components. BOB smartphone is available for pre-order on Xwallet and Kickstarter with a retail price of $599.
