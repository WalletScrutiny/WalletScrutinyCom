## Product Description

> LetheKit is a do-it-youself platform for performing various sensitive cryptographic operations on an offline airgapped device. It uses no WiFi or Bluetooth which could leak information and contains no local storage, and when the device is turned off it forgets any sensitive data stored in RAM. Thus the name Lethe (lee-thee), from the mythological river of forgetfulness and oblivion.

> Users can roll a physical dice or generate hardware entropy to create truly random seeds
>
> Gordian LetheKit is a hardware exemplar meant to display the Gordian Principles, which are philosophical and technical underpinnings to Blockchain Commons' Gordian technology. This includes:
> 
- Independence. LetheKit ensures that you're in total control of your seeds.
- Privacy. LetheKit is totally offline.
- Resilience. LetheKit depends on you for its resilience, since you must back up your words or codes.
- Openness. LetheKit communicates through airgaps via URs and QRs, for maximum interoperability.

## Analysis 

The {{ page.title }} is in late alpha development stage. As a **DIY** device, it can perform the following functions: 

> - Display the seed in UR, QR code, or text. 
- The seed can also be converted into BIP39 words. 
- Construct HD-keys to view them on another wallet. 
- It is also possible to view bitcoin address derived from mnemonic seeds with BIP32. 
- Wallet descriptors can be exported to another device.
