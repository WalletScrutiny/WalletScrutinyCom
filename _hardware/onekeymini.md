## Product Description 

Not to be confused with the {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/onekey' verdict='true' %}, the One Key Mini supports many cryptocurrencies including: BTC, LTC, BCH, ETH, BTG, DASH, USDT, DOGE and more. It supports many DeFi protocols and can connect to Metamask.

It is also compatible with Trezor, Metamask, Exodus, Bitcoin Core + Specter, BTCPayServe, Electrum-LTC, Nano Wallet, Electrum, Mycelium, MyEtherWallet, Bitcoin Core + HWI, Electrum- DASH and EtherWall.

According to the [FAQ](https://shop.onekey.so/pages/faq), even if the device was damaged, it is possible to recover via a mnemonic phrase.

The private keys are created offline, secured and airgapped. The mnemonic phrase is provided during initial device setup.

OneKey repeatedly claims that their software and firmwares are Open Source. However, the repository linked from their website indicates that it is already [deprecated](https://github.com/OneKeyHQ/wallet-deprecated). 

Digging deeper into their User Service Agreement, we find this:

> OneKeyOpen Source Code (“OneKey OSC”): means the partial software code of OneKey that Company has publicized and made open-source. Users may use (include further development) such open source software code in accordance with relevant Open Source License and notices of the Company.

The key word is "partial". Making the **source code only partially available** indicates that certain functions are not made public. This is noted in an [issue on OneKey's Github](https://github.com/OneKeyHQ/firmware/issues/17), but it has not received any attention.

Whether it's a few lines of code that references a script downloaded from another source, users simply would not know.
