## Product Description 

> OrigoKey is a state of the art hardware wallet in which you can store your extremely sensitive blockchain access credentials controlling for example your digital currencies in the most secure way. The device generates and stores your highly confidential transaction authentication keys and authenticates transactions with currently unbreakable and non-bypassable security technology, using a physically secure microcontroller.

**No Recovery Sheet Required**

> Origokey is able to create your wallet from a file stored on an SD card. This arbitrary file can be an image, a text file, a pdf or any other file of your choice. You can store your recovery file wherever you want to, nobody will realize it functions as your secret key as well.
