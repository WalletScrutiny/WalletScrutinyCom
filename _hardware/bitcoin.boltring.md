The BoltRing currently has the BoltCard (NTAG 424 DNA) Read/Write library in its [repository](https://github.com/bitcoin-ring/boltlib).

## Analysis 

BoltRing's main selling point is that it allows users to quickly and easily sign contactless Bitcoin transaction payments. It does not hold bitcoin/your private keys, instead connecting to your wallet through a bolt service.

Source from the [FAQ:](https://bitcoin-ring.com/pages/faq)

> **What if I lose my BoltRing?**
> Your BoltRing does not hold bitcoin. Instead it is connected with an online lightning wallet through a bolt service. You can deactivate the connected bolt service if you lose your BoltRing.
>
> **How secure is the BoltRing?**
> The BoltRing uses a secure NFC chip that dynamically generates replay protected LNURL-Withdraw links. To improve security you should set reasonable limits and timeouts on the connected bolt service. Remember the BoltRing is not a hardware wallet. Use it responsibly with small amounts for daily spending only.

As the providers themselves state that BoltRing is **not a wallet,** there's no need to review it any further.
