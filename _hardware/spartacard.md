## Analysis 

There were no references to the project being open and no links to any repository. Their homepage, spartacard.com is no longer accessible. The project was only able to raise $534 of the target $20,000 [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/spartacard-transactional-crypto-hardware-wallet#/) goal. The project's main personalities have since moved on to different projects. 

With no sufficient financial backing, this project has not seen the light of day.
