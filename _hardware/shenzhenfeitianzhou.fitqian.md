## Background 

The {{ page.title }} tried to capitalize on cryptocurrency interest by combining the idea of a smartwatch with a cryptocurrency hardware wallet. We could not locate Shenzhen Feitianzhou Technology Co., Ltd.'s website, but were able to find a listing on tradewheel.com. Interested buyers must inquire with them first via webform. The last social media posts for the Fitqian on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=356416808313519&id=294969777791556&__cft__[0]=AZVFf9Tcuq1ZtPBLrscyLwj6IGfbhzZUSiexOqNibvcW_Rhbhcp5Z0ohAFacx4qa9ut4I59GRNGRK30rDK10slL2P-dAFkRNhWzsJDwaqA8YpdMrQ9-Y-qobUbr3m5qU8YnCRWeVRCq65ocxOStUdhXO&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R) was made on April 26, 2019.

## Analysis 

Wallet creation occurs on the actual device and the mnemonics are given. The watch can be paired with the Fitqian app. We were not able to locate the app. From the video demonstration, we were able to glean that transaction details are not displayed from the watch. In lieu of the transaction details, an OTP appears on the watch which the user must then input on the mobile phone app. 

We could not find information on whether the watch adheres to BIP standards. It was also not described as an open-source project. However, we could see from tradewheel that it is still possible to contact Shenzhen Feitianzhou Technology Co., Ltd. to inquire about the device. Since we could not locate its home page, we were also **not able to find a related repository.**
