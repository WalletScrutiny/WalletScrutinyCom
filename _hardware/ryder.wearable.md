## Product Description

> the current Ryder prototype is a full implementation of the current Blockstack authentication algorithm
>
> Blockstack is a blockchain-based ecosystem where users retain control over their identities and data. 
>
> It currently features new wallet generation in hardware, recovery via seed input, identity selection, and more. To be compatible with the current authentication flow, it still exports the app private key, but this is merely a temporary measure to guarantee compatibility. The prototype is fully functional and can be used today. 

Marvin Janssen is the co-founder of Ryder. He envisions Ryder to be part of a "[hardware identity keychain.](https://marvinjanssen.medium.com/beyond-the-private-key-building-a-blockstack-hardware-identity-keychain-46418d90efd2)". This schema is further discussed in this diagram:

Ryder [received a grant of 5,000 USD from the Stacks Foundation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDuDW--LIr8) in 2021. It is in this video where they stated that they incorporated in Singapore.

## Analysis

Janssen stated that *"I really hope Ryder can be more than just another crypto wallet."* They have sent out the first batch of watches to what he described as the "pioneers". 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It is programming day. <a href="https://t.co/U8bnASMScM">pic.twitter.com/U8bnASMScM</a></p>&mdash; Ryder.btc (@Ryder_ID) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ryder_ID/status/1356743693911293952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 2, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

He continues: 

> The Pioneers will provide the first feedback and allow us to reach the next milestone: a crowdfunding campaign. The next big task is to get Ryder up to speed and see how we can fit it into the Stacks 2.0 ecosystem.

As of April 8, 2022, Ryder is currently holding a pre-sale for Ryder NFTs. The NFTs are said to be redeemable for the device itself. 

> 2% of the sale will go to Ryder Open Hardware Development Fund
>
> There are seven Ryder NFT pledger tiers. Each comes with benefits and incentives packages as a thank you to our early supporters. Additionally, each tier comes with its unique rewards. Of course, the higher the tier, the better the reward.

The "basic" tier costs 50 STX. [1 STX costs roughly 1.27 USD as of 2022-04-08](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stacks/). STX is currently trading in Binance.

Many of the specifics for the project - which encompasses not just the hardware wallet but other things as well, are discussed more thoroughly on their discord channel:

@here another update for the maker community, in terms of manufacturing and where we are at. The general strategy is to work with a design house to deliver the 1st version of Ryder. We finished the commercial specification doc and from this document, the Technical Consultant will create a technical specification which he is currently doing. In this technical doc, we will describe the device functionality and pre-select device components which will be forwarded to the Design House as the preliminary technical vision. Shoutout to @bongbong for sending some choices on this. 
> 
> Before we move forward to the design house, we're still ironing out the following together with the technical consultant
>
> - Hardware requirements to support existing Ryder's firmware 
> - Hardware and software protection technologies
> - Efforts for implementing firmware drivers for porting Ryder's firmware from the hardware abstraction
> - Material Selection

If we're not mistaken, the only way to currently "purchase" the hardware wallet is by participating in the NFT pre-sale they're holding. Although prototypes of the device has clearly been seen online, it is not available for purchase through conventional means - such as a shopping cart. As such we determine this device as **not yet released** until further notice.
