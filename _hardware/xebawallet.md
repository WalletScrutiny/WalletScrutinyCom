{{ page.title }} only has a single webpage with information and details about the product. Unfortunately, this information is limited and there aren't any clear images of the product. Searching online does not return many results, either.

At the page's footer, the copyright notice reads:

> Copyright © XebaWallet 2019

The site gives some information about the product. Presumably, {{ page.title }} was meant to be credit card-sized and includes NFC technology.

> XebaWallet is a secure hardware wallet for cryptocurrencies in credit card size with NFC connectivity and you can use it with your smartphone. XebaWallet has a new hardware-to-hardware backup with no need to mnemonic words. Entire code runs in a secure element chip with MasterCard/Visa Card security grade. With superwallet-subwallet schema, XebaWallet can divide coins between small and large amount for better security and more availability.

In the site's "About" section, the latest update was made on February 2019.

> XebaWallet Is Born. XebaWallet card proto-type and mobile app is ready to proof our innovations. In addition, we filed three patents.

Due to the lack of any additional information about this product or any way to confirm if it is actually in production, we have to assume it is either **defunct** or **unreleased.**
