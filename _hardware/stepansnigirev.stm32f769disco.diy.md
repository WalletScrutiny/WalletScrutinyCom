> Currently focusing on STM32F769DISCO developer board. Support of other boards comes as soon as this one is stable enough.
>
> ## Project structure
> 
> micropython folder contains a fork of micropython with some temporary workarounds for stm32f769 board. Currently the master branch of micropython fails to build for this target, as soon as it is fixed we will switch to the main micropython repo.
>
> - usermods/mpy-bitcoin folder contains minimal C-modules for micropython with basic crypto algorithms. Interface to optimized C modules allow to use optimized elliptic curve arithmetics and hashing functions:
>
> - usermods/mpy-bitcoin/hashlib.c adds support of sha1, sha256, sha512 and ripemd160 required for Bitcoin to hashlib python module.
>
> - usermods/mpy-display/ folder contains a C-module to work with the display present on the board.
