The provider's site has clear information on this hardware wallet, however we cannot find anyway of buying this product. The provider's [last tweet](https://twitter.com/io_wallet/status/1310456761908826115) from September 2020 announces the product's distribution as "Wallet S1".

It all looks like vaporware with some affiliate incentives given the above tweet is getting tons of replies of people praising the project, mentioning others even years after that **last** tweet.
