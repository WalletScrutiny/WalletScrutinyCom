**⚠️ Note:** From the wordings in the product description, the Mitilena "hardware" wallet can be "downloaded" and installed on a USB flash drive, desktop computer or a mobile phone. We can find no spefications for the "hardware wallet". Please see analysis below for further information.

## Product Description

We could not find pictures of the Mitilena Hardware wallet. As of today, March 15, 2022, Mitilena has no linked social media accounts. They are also selling a token called Vanishing Mitilena (VMT) which is only available in one cryptocurrency exchange, Tokpie.

Description of [how Mitilena works](https://mitelena.com/differences-between-cold-and-hot-wallets-why-can-mitilena-work-in-both-modes/):

> In short: the cryptographic process of signing transactions in the blockchain does not have to be done online, you can sign a transaction on a computer or phone that never goes online and therefore it is almost impossible for an attacker to get into the interaction between you -> an offline device. When you sign an offline transaction, you will have a result code (hash). This hash must be published on at least one blockchain node and your transaction will appear on the blockchain. Moreover, this hash is not a password and knowing it is not enough for someone to find out your password (private key).
>
> You signed the transaction offline, copied the hash, turned off the device, and then on dozens of sites you can publish this hash in public nodes.
>
> These are all conventional concepts, our wallet works in mixed mode and it has several modes:
>
> 1. Even the very first mode of operation, which we can hardly call a hot wallet, works safer than a hot wallet. Regular hot wallets keep your private keys (passwords) on the servers of the wallet developer company. Someone will hack the wallet developer -> will automatically hack you too. With us, your private key is stored in your browser and is never sent to our server, even in the free version. Your private key is stored in your browser and encrypted with your PIN code.
>
> 2. The second mode, paid, is an offline program for a computer or phone, in which you can sign transactions offline and even store (if you want) your private keys. When you need to send a cryptocurrency to someone, you simply fill out where and to whom on our website, then our wallet generates a special object with data or a QR code for you, you insert it into the offline transaction confirmation module, sign the transaction and get the hash that you need publish to the blockchain through our website or any other node. There is a huge plus of our wallet here, you can keep the program on any USB flash drive, you do not need to wait until you receive a special flash drive by mail. Buy the program and upload it to any of your USB flash drives. The data is encrypted there, but it is still of course better to store it in a little accessible place. And also, you can have a program without a USB flash drive, just on a computer, anyone. Either on any iOS / Android phone, while. Ideally keep on some old phone, where you never connect to the Internet. In the case of iOS, you can keep the program on your work iPhone, as there are high security standards. Also, by purchasing the paid version, you also get an offline web version, where you can sign transactions in a private tab with the Internet turned off.

## Analysis

We could not find any specifications or pictures for the flash drives they claim would be sent by mail. We find it odd for Mitilena to use the word "download" for a "hardware wallet". It seems that their hardware wallet is really just software that could be installed on any desktop, usb flash drive or mobile phone. Prior to downloading the "hardware wallet", the user must pay at the very least, $146.9 USD. We also could not find any linked publicly available source code. We also find it odd that its primary URL, mitilena.com, links to mitelena.com for its blog posts. The browser gave us a warning about the misspelling. 

Other sources for information about this product is a Czech website with the word "invest" in their domain. We found it difficult to give a verdict for this product. At the very least, we know that it is **not a hardware wallet**. Since we have to pay to access the software, we were not able to see precisely how it works. It is possible to generate a wallet from their site using a browser. The user has to disconnect the computer and load a private tab or window to commence. Then it will show the [generated private key](https://generate.mitilena.com) on the browser. 

Our standards require [no reliance on insecure external hardware](/methodology/#what-is-a-hardware-wallet).
