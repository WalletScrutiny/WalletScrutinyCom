If a hardware wallet based on a Samsung J3 exists as a Samsung J3, does the project still exist? This project held [an ICO](https://medium.com/@cryptoyoga/hodler-the-only-ico-with-an-annual-83de9463f26b) where they promised annual dividends:

> When you buy HDL at a stage of Pre sale with 40% bonus with the amount of 300 USD the total accumulated purchased HDL token, you will receive 42 000 and the annual company’s profit 20 000 000 USD and your total ROI (200%) will be 840 USD.

The last post on [Hodler Tech's facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/hodler.tech/posts/1888548787887072) has to do with their ICO, wherein they offer token bonuses.

They claim that their software is open source, however the [last commit](https://github.com/HODLERTECH/HODLER-Open-Source-Multi-Asset-Wallet/commit/a8c54ecfc569d0ee959b6f0e7826c4ee4b5c4848) was made on Oct. 29, 2019.

The app on Google Play still exists though even though the last update was made on October 29, 2019:

With no updates beyond 2019, a stagnant social media presence, an offline website, an ICO that promised annual dividends and a project which is based on another product - the Samsung phone, it is prudent to assume that this project **no longer exists**.
