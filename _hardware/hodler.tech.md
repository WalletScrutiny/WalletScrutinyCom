If a hardware wallet based on a Samsung J3 exists as a Samsung J3, does the project still exist? This project held [an ICO](https://medium.com/@cryptoyoga/hodler-the-only-ico-with-an-annual-83de9463f26b) where they promised annual dividends:

> When you buy HDL at a stage of Pre sale with 40% bonus with the amount of 300 USD the total accumulated purchased HDL token, you will receive 42 000 and the annual companyâ€™s profit 20 000 000 USD and your total ROI (200%) will be 840 USD.

The last post on [Hodler Tech's facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/hodler.tech/posts/1888548787887072) has to do with their ICO, wherein they offer token bonuses.

They claim that their software is open source, however the [last commit](https://github.com/HODLERTECH/HODLER-Open-Source-Multi-Asset-Wallet/commit/a8c54ecfc569d0ee959b6f0e7826c4ee4b5c4848) was made on Oct. 29, 2019.

The app on Google Play still exists though even though the last update was made on October 29, 2019:

With no updates beyond 2019, a stagnant social media presence, an offline website, an ICO that promised annual dividends and a project which is based on another product - the Samsung phone, it is prudent to assume that this project **no longer exists**.
