## Private keys can be created offline - ✔️

These are the steps to follow during initialization, [watch the video demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggMnN6dIHwY)

## Private keys are not shared - ✔️

> The private keys generated by the BitLox hardware wallet NEVER leave the device when in use - period. When you switch your BitLox off, the funds contained therein are absolutely safe and secure. When you use your BitLox to access your funds, all authorization is done on the device itself - entering your PIN, checking transactions to make sure you are sending what you want to send, and what fees you are paying. 
>
> The device has a PIN code to prevent unauthorized access, each wallet may have a PIN code, each TRANSACTION may be set up to be verified by a PIN code. And by the way, these PIN codes may be up to 20 digits - numbers AND letters, lowercase and uppercase. If someone tries to guess a PIN, after but a few attempts a mandatory security delay kicks in. 

## Device displays receive address for confirmation - ✔️

As [shown in the video demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggMnN6dIHwY) the display is an epaper screen which also displays the QR code which stays on even when the device is turned off. 

## Interface - ✔️

The Bitlox has a 2" full matrix e-paper display with a full alphanumeric keypad (12 buttons)

## Code and Reproducibility

Bitlox made this announcement: 

> Effective immediately, we have decided in the interests of our users to
  publish the source code for the apps that users use to communicate with the
  BitLox and the blockchain plus the device firmware.
>
> You may find the source code for our iOS, Android, Chrome and Web apps and the
  device firmware at [Github](https://github.com/bitlox)

So while we are not sure when this announcement was made, the latest
contribution to the firmware repository dates back to 2017, making the project
**obsolete** by our standard. Others
[asked about the status](https://github.com/BitLox/bitlox-firmware/issues/3) of
the product and the provider claimed it was still being actively maintained - in
February 2021 but with no update following this, we stick to our verdict until
further notice.
