## Analysis 

Quoted from [BitcoinTalk:](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4641751.msg41980381#msg41980381) 

> Unlike those devices (Ledger and Trezor) BitLock doesn't have a screen and buttons, and the authentication is performed on mobile phone. If you know, both are vulnerable because of insecure chip used for interacting with the screen, when Trezor doesn't have secured kernel at all. In Bitlock all software works within the kernel of smart-card. 

**All transactions are [confirmed via the mobile phone](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4641751.msg42104784#msg42104784)**

> All transactions are confirmed on mobile that authorises data from BitLock received through secured by asymmetric RSA2048 algorithm channel.

Several years have passed and we do not see vestiges of the Bitlock device. From the description, however, we can glean that the device can be plugged into the USB port of a computer or through an adaptor on an Android mobile phone. 

We can also glean that the device has no interface.  

Transactions are confirmed via their own software. 

With these, **Bitlock most likely never went into production**.
