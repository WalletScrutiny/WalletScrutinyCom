## Product Description 

Initially offered for pre-order, there is no known status for the device and whether it has been delivered. The associated coin ($COIN) has been declared by [99bitcoins.com](https://99bitcoins.com/deadcoins/#nnbitcoins-deadcoins-list) as 'dead' due to the following reasons: 

- Inactive Development
- Inactive Twitter
- Low Volume
- Not indexed
- Not Listed on exchanges
- Website Down

Their [thread on bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2381017.1580) seems to indicate the same.

## Analysis

Despite numerous marketing material, there is nothing to indicate that this product ever made it to market. The existence of an ICO further aggravates this and points to a product that is merely vaporware.
