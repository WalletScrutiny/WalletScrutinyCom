Ellipal claims to go beyond being a hardware wallet. It describes itself as an "Air-gapped cold storage hardware wallet" with no possibility of connecting to the Internet at all. It is also described as having anti-tampering and anti-disassembly features. The makers claim that the "chip will delete every data when it detects a breach". 

## Private keys can be created offline

Since the device is air-gapped, the private keys are generated offline. 

## Private keys are not shared 

The means for Ellipal to connect to the Internet and make a transaction occur through a companion app that could be installed on Android or iOS. The hardware wallet communicates with this companion app via a QR code. Ellipal claims that that the QR code does not transmit or share the private keys. Ellipal has published the specifications for their use of the [QR code on Github (PDF file)](https://github.com/ELLIPAL/air-gapped_qrcode_data_format/blob/master/ELLIPAL_AIR-GAPPED_QRCODE_DATA_FORMAT_R1.18.pdf).

## Device displays receive address for confirmation

The Ellipal hardware wallet is very dependent on the downloadable companion app because the user needs to have the two devices on hand in order to send a transaction. A tutorial on how to send transactions is described [here](https://www.ellipal.com/blogs/support/send-transaction-on-cold-wallet). 

When sending transactions, the companion app generates an "unsigned data QR code". The user then uses the Ellipal hardware wallet to "sign" this transaction by scanning the QR code that was generated by the companion app. Once the QR code has been scanned, the transaction details are presented this time on the Ellipal device. The user has to confirm this. Once confirmed, the Ellipal device then generates its own **signed** data QR code using the companion app. The user then has to scan the signed data QR code generated on the Ellipal hardware wallet using the companion app. Only then will the transaction be consummated.

## Interface

The device has the basic appearance of a smart phone, with a camera and a touchscreen.

## Reproducibility

Ellipal believes that [open source does not necessarily mean better security](https://www.ellipal.com/blogs/news/how-much-does-open-source-contribute-to-security).

> Open-source is indeed useful for users and experts to perform audits and do reviews. However, open-source doesn't lead to safer solutions naturally. 
>
> Occasionally, open-source can be cracked easily by hackers because the resources, codes, and utilities are readily available. There are many vulnerabilities on open source products such as the Trezor, the most famous open-source hardware wallet. *Ref 1. Unfixable Seed Extraction on Trezor - A practical and reliable attack. **Ref 2. Crack Trezor in 15minutes.

They are open about being closed source and thus **not verifiable**.
