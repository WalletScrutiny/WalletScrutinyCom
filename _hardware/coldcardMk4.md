> - Debug serial port moved to pins, rather than being virtual over USB

## Analysis 

Aesthetically, the ColdCard hardware wallets look physically similar. Note however, that Mark 4 is still in pre-order so there may be variations with the Mark 3 that will only become apparent once it is officially released. According to the review of the {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/coldcardMk3' %}, there are still some issues that need to be resolved. It was confirmed on Twitter that the Mark 4 would be using the same [firmware version 4.1.3](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1503293167478931463) as the Mark 3. This means that the Mark 4 will inherit the same [issues](https://gitlab.com/walletscrutiny/walletScrutinyCom/-/issues/340). Consequently, this should mean that it will also inherit the same verdict. However, since the product is **not yet released**, a verdict reflecting that state would give them the benefit of the doubt.
