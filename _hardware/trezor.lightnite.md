The Trezor LIGHTNITE is a branded, limited-edition version of the {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/trezorT' verdict='true' %} as part of a [premium bundle](https://blog.lightnite.io/trezor-partnership/) for the Light Nite gaming community. It was the result of a partnership with Trezor.

On September 8, 2020, the providers posted [a tweet](https://twitter.com/lightnitegame/status/1303323744073584642) promoting the product. They linked a website where users could purchase the product. This site's [archived copy](https://web.archive.org/web/20201113073033/http://trezor.lightnite.io/) reveals that there were only 50 units for sale. This gives us cause to assume that the units were all sold out, meaning that Trezor LIGHTNITE is no longer available for purchase and thus can be qualified as **defunct**.

While due to the low impact we did not do this research yet, if you have such a device you can see if you can update to the usual Trezor Model T firmware checking for the correct fingerprint. If that is the case, the Model T's verdict applies, too.
