## Product Description 

The project's main url used to be ethereumphone.org. This domain now redirects to ethosmobile.org. The primary content does not show any hardware device yet. We filed this in hardware with the expectation they will come up with a hardware device soon. 

## Analysis 

While the hardware device is not yet released, the WalletManager repository on its organization page indicate: 

> Supports L1, Layer 2s, and other EVM based chains.

No mention of BTC support is mentioned but we [asked](https://github.com/EthereumPhone/WalletManager/issues/3) to verify if they would support BTC.
