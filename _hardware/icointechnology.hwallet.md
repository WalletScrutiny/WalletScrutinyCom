## Can the private keys be created offline? - ✔️ 

Yes. The [Quick Start Guide](https://icointechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Quick-Start-Guide-v8.pdf) describes the process: 

> Create a New Bitcoin Account
1. Select BITCOIN on your wallet homescreen
2. Use the symbol to create a new account
3. Choose a name for your account and press CONFIRM
- View your account address & QR code
- PRINT to create a hard copy of your account address & QR code

✔️ - The provider claims the device is air gapped with Bluetooth as an **option**. 

✔️ - Information is communicated between two devices using QR codes.  

## Are the private keys shared? - ✔️

No. Described above: when creating a transaction, the device scans a **QR code generated by the hardware device** or printed through {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/icointechnology.printer' %}. 

Furthermore, it is described as: 

> Unlike a smartphone, the iCoin hardware wallet has no hardware or software support for Wi-Fi, cellular or GPS communication, which can threaten security. It uses a camera and displays QR codes to receive and send information to the iCoin Mobile App (air gap connection) which runs on iOS and Android smartphones. The iCoin Mobile App uses the smartphone Wi-Fi or cellular connection to relay the transaction information to the blockchain.  iCoin also operates its own full node blockchain server for improved transaction security. An optional Bluetooth printer securely connects to the hardware wallet for seed phrase and other printouts.

Here, we should assume the qr does what it does in the many other such hardware wallets - display [PSBT](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/psbt/)s.

## Does the device display the receive address for confirmation? - ✔️ 

Yes. Step 6 of creating transactions is described: 

> Confirm transaction details on your hardware wallet and press NEXT

## Does the interface have a display screen and buttons which allows the user to confirm transaction details? - ✔️ 

Yes. 

## Is it reproducible? - ❌ 

There is no link to any source code from the provider's website. 

## Conclusion

The project **does not link to any source code.**
