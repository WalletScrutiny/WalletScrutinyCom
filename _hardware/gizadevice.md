Giza was an ICO scam which reportedly made off with 2 million dollars, complete with [a fake COO.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EpGo0dS3nZbyutL3fN-m1dqZl768Y8Ix/view) These events took place in early 2018. 

Along with [many](https://walletinvestor.com/magazine/early-investors-lost-2-million-usd-to-scammers-running-a-fake-ico/) [other](https://www.pymnts.com/news/security-and-risk/2018/scammers-launch-fake-ico-steal-2m-investors-giza/) tech news websites, [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/09/cryptocurrency-scammers-of-giza-make-off-with-2-million-after-ico.html) made an article about the scam and the events leading up to it.

As Giza was revealed to be an exit scam, we can conclude that this "product" will never be released.
