## Background 

Splash announcement on Goldlinks.one's [homepage](https://www.goldlinks.one): 

> Recently, the trading of Goldlinks GGT on BitForex has been halted. To date, Bitforex has no any official explanation on the unilateral suspension. Goldlinks is requesting an official statement from BitForex and communicating with them. We will endeavor to resume the trading as soon as possible.

The [whitepaper](https://www.goldlinks.one/uploadfile/upload/file/20190807/2019080710421177.pdf) describes a token and a coin: GGT and GGC

> By combining cutting-edge blockchain technology with physical gold, Goldlinks Platform is uniting gold producers, consumers, investors, and other gold stakeholders in a global blockchain community. Goldlinks Platform has transformed gold into a divisible, tokenized asset known as Global Gold Coins (GGC). This functions as a universal store of value and unlocks gold's natural monetary properties in a digital world.

GGT 

> GGT is initially issued by the Distributor as ERC-20 standard compliant digital tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The total circulation of GGT is 20 billion GGT. GGT is a non-refundable functional utility token which will be used as the unit of exchange between participants on the Goldlinks Platform. The goal of introducing GGT is to provide a convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement between participants who interact within the ecosystem on the Goldlinks Platform. 

## Product Description 

The hardware wallet was [announced on twitter](https://twitter.com/GoldlinksGlobal/status/1133631475104923648) on May 29, 2019.

This information can be found on this [page](https://www.goldlinks.one/list.php?pid=3&ty=28#safe):

> - Private keys are generated and stored in a Secure Element (SE).
- Sensitive data is isolated on a chip operating system (COS), preventing storage and signature attacks.
- A propriety design that combines hardware and software wallets offers an extra level of protection.
- the hardware wallet directly connects to the software wallet on mobile devices via Bluetooth, eliminating the need to install PC software or
drivers. 

## Analysis 

The [last tweet](https://twitter.com/GoldlinksGlobal/status/1194131880662056967) of the Goldlinks twitter account was made on November 12, 2019. The 'Buy' link for the hardware wallet is broken. The last [Medium post](https://medium.com/@GoldlinksGlobal/goldlinks%E5%85%AB%E6%9C%88%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A5%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9%E5%8B%95%E5%90%91-37c3b04f64d3) was made on September 2, 2019. Goldlinks' wallet app download is [also broken](https://www.goldlinks.one/walletdownload/index.html).

This information together with the delisting of the GGT on BitForex plus the subsequent loss of value of GGT from a high of [20 cents to 0.000427 cents](https://coinranking.com/coin/pQp728dTL7Id+globalgoldtoken-ggt), lead us to come to the conclusion that this hardware wallet **no longer exists**. 

Since the device connects to a mobile app via Bluetooth, we assume that the device has the possibility to **leak the private keys**.
