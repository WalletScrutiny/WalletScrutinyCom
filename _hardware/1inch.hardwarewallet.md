## Background Information

The domain name and the twitter handle describes a generic sounding product: "hardware wallet". However, the rendering of the device bears the logo of 1inch - a DeFi aggregator platform. The project was announced in December 2021. 

## Product Description 

The social media account claims: 

> HARDWARE WALLET is a hardware cold wallet for storing cryptocurrency that includes many technologies within a small device similar to a bank card.
>
- 3 mm compact form of a bank card
- Independent secure element EAL 5+
- Wireless charger
- Autonomour air gap signature transaction with bi-directional QR code
- Multiple wallet sets for different code and fingerprint combinations
- Large easy-to-operate touch screen that shows everything
- 1 inch is the # 1 DeFi aggregator offering. Direct integration with a 1 inch wallet will allow you to exchange currencies at a favorable rate and securely store your assets in a cold wallet

## Analysis 

The generic sounding domain and the lack of recent activity on the social media post lead us to believe that this wallet is not yet released. We [reached](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1515266499480801282) out to Alexander Devyatkin as well as the twitter account to ask about the status of the project.

He [replied:](https://twitter.com/alexey9kin/status/1515317235170131970)

> Hey! The device is not yet for sale, but we are actively working. To date, we have completed testing of all hardware and software solutions, active work is underway to develop the firmware and device case.

This confirms the device is **not yet released**.
