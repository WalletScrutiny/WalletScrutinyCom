## Updated Review 2024-10-18

From this [Medium post](https://medium.com/@hrdwlt/monthly-update-s-31eb13c5fc41) dated October 4, 2024:

> Hardware Updates:
>
> - We wrapped up the test firmware for internal evaluation before sealing the device casing. It was handed over to our electronics team, who confirmed that all connectors  were securely in place and that nothing was damaged during installation. These checks were key to making sure our devices are reliable and fully functional.
> - September will also be remembered for our work on power optimization. We introduced dynamic frequency adjustments for the main controller, lowering its frequency during idle times to save energy and cranking it up during active tasks. This tweak cut idle power consumption down to just 10â€“20 milliamps, significantly boosting energy efficiency and extending battery life.
> - Our biggest pride this month was making huge strides in developing the most compact camera to meet our performance standards, including a 15 cm focal length and support for QR code density up to 85. After six months of collaboration with our partners, we successfully created a super compact 4x4x3 mm camera that hits all our targets.
Excitingly, weâ€™re also teaming up with our factory to make corrections and finalize the design for mass production. Now that weâ€™ve wrapped up the Device Validation Test (DVT) phase, weâ€™re making a few minor tweaks to the design as we gear up for the final PVT sample, which will serve as the foundation for mass production.

1inch has updated its website's design and listed some technical specifications. Below is a tweet from 1inch's social media account that suggests that the product is nearing an official release.

## Previous Review 2022-04-29

## Product Description 

1inch's offical website states that it is a multi-seed wallet. Wallet set creation involves the usage of the HD Wallet algorithm along with BIP44.

Images of the product show that it will have a touchscreen display, QR code scanner, and the user will be asked to write down and save the generated seed phrase. Users will also be able to use NFC cards to sign transactions.

1inch has an official Github account so there is a chance that the firmware will be made available in the future. However, we cannot make a conclusive statement on reproducibility until the product is officially released.
