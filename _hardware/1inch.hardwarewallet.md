## Product Description 

1inch's offical website states that it is a multi-seed wallet. Wallet set creation involves the usage of the HD Wallet algorithm along with BIP44.

Images of the product show that it will have a touchscreen display, QR code scanner, and the user will be asked to write down and save the generated seed phrase. Users will also be able to use NFC cards to sign transactions.

1inch has an official Github account so there is a chance that the firmware will be made available in the future. However, we cannot make a conclusive statement on reproducibility until the product is officially released.
