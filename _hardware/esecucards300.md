## Analysis 

We could not find any documentation on how the Excel Secucard S300 specifically functions as a bitcoin wallet. Although the technical specifications for the card itself are detailed in its product specification sheet, we discovered that Excel Secu had other products that are similar iterations of the card. Excelsecu seems to be a business-to-business manufacturer with general marketing directed towards other sellers. Thus, a consumer who wants to buy a bitcoin hardware wallet would not find information such as how the private key is handled on the device. We assume that it would be another party or business which would program hardware wallet capabilities. 

> Our main products includes PKI Digital signature token, One-Time-Password OTP token, FIDO U2F Security Key, Smart Card, Java card, Bluetooth Card, Display Card, Bitcoin cryptocurrency hardware wallets, smart wearable devices.

## What We Do Know

- The product is marketed as a bitcoin hardware wallet albeit with sparse documentation
- It has both input and output interfaces suitable for generating a QR code.
- It claims to have a secure element 
- We could not find a companion app

We have no way of knowing how the private key is stored and **could not find any linked publicly available source code**. We also could not find tutorials or relevant reviews. Assuming that we take their word for it that the device is indeed a bitcoin hardware wallet and functions as such, and without knowledge whether the **private keys are created during the manufacturing process**, we can only make an educated guess for the verdict.
