## Service Overview 

Bitcoin POS Italy has a range of [services](https://bitcoinpos.it/ilservizio.html#features1-k) aimed at commercial customers. 

Its "POS Virtuale" (or Retail) service, is a simple web interface allowing retail merchants to accept payments.

Its "Remote Payments" service, allows merchants to request payments through email, Whatsapp, Telegram, sms or any messaging system. 

Its "Quick Purchases" service allows merchants to sell online without a website. This is done through a link or a QR code.

**NO ADDITIONAL HARDWARE**

> All you need is a smartphone, a tablet or a PC.

## Terms of Service 

Details are found on this [page](https://bitcoinpos.it/tos.html).

> inbitcoin allows you to accept bitcoins as a payment for goods or services and to carry out the payment process using bitcoins. inbitcoin is not an Exchange, Bitcoin Wallet, or a service dedicated to the purchase of bitcoins. By using our services, you authorize us to receive, hold and disburse funds in your name and take all actions we deem necessary or advisable to provide the services in compliance with applicable regulations.

## Analysis 

Although it may appear that they have a physical Point-of-Sale device like the one rendered on their website, their range of services and the lack of hardware spefications makes us think otherwise. Rather, we believe this is a consultancy that combines software and hardware solutions depending on a customer's needs. Even so, a Bitcoin PoS **does not function as a hardware wallet**.
