**⚠️ Note:** Sidera held an ICO with [some concerns](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5062167.0) arising from the bitcointalk community.

## Product Description

The Smartbit watch is described as a Decentralized Wearable Device.

> Your funds are secured around your wrist, fully encrypted, allowing offline wrist-to-wrist transactions and a plethora of other innovative characteristics.

The main webpage of the provider is no longer there but we still managed to get a description from a related [Medium post](https://medium.com/@olartbaraq247/sidera-smartbit-guide-on-how-to-receive-send-and-manage-cryptocurrencies-eb6c11dfdc89): 

> The built-in software permits users to receive Bitcoins or any other existing token directly on the wrist generating new addresses. It is possible to generate a new address from the smartwatch/wristband simply by pressing a button.This new address can be displayed as a QR Code for fast “on-street/outdoor” currency operations. It is also possible to share the address to contacts. If the user needs to receive a specific amount of money the smartwatch can generate a QR Code for that amount of money. The user has the possibility to choose whether to share the code to contacts (integration with external apps like Messages, WhatsApp, etc) or to display it directly.

## Verdict 

After the ICO, there were allegations that the price of the token has abruptly gone down. Its site and social media has been scrubbed. We could not find a video review of the product anywhere. We do not believe that the Sidera Smartbit has been released and is thus, **vaporware.**
