As the name implies, Specter solutions is allowing Bitcoin enthusiasts to build their own hardware wallets by releasing the source code publicly and by sharing do-it-yourself video tutorials on how to assemble their hardware wallet.

## Can the private keys be created offline? Yes.

Once the users are successful in piecing together the necessary components, [setting up the device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H7FqG_FmCw) and creating the private keys are the next steps.

## Are the private keys shared? No.

The device is airgapped save for the time when the firmware is flashed via a micro USB port (prior to setup).

## Does the device display the receive address for confirmation? Yes.

The device's display adequately displays details of the transaction prior to confirmation.

## Is it reproducible?

The project is **"do-it-yourself"** and the firmware's source code is public, so there's a certain level of openness to it. With that said, it would be interesting to investigate this offering further.
