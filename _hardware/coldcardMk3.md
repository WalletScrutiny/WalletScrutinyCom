correspondence:

## Full Correspondence

As the provider doesn't maintain a public issue tracker, it's a bit hard to be
fully transparent but we try our best ...

# The Analysis

The provider makes clear claims:

> **COLDCARD Hardware Wallet**<br>
  âœ“ Bitcoin Only<br>
  âœ“ Open-Source<br>
  âœ“ Easy-to-Use<br>
  âœ“ Ultra-Secure<br>
  âœ“ Loved by Cypherpunks

and on [their repository: Reproducible Builds](https://github.com/Coldcard/firmware#reproducible-builds):

> To have confidence this source code tree is the same as the binary on your
  device, you can rebuild it from source and get **exactly the same bytes**.

Also the product is packed with security features, some unique to the
{{ page.title }}.

An anti-feature we would like to know why it's actually a feature is

> Because of the in-depth use of the secure element, there is no "factory reset"
  for the Coldcard. If you forget your Coldcard PIN, there is nothing we can do
  except remind you to recycle your e-waste responsibly!

meaning that if you ever forget your PIN even if you have your seed phrase, your
device is worthless. To our knowledge, no other device works like this and we
see no good reason why this could be advantageous to the user or more secure.

The "secure element" comes with another implication: Code run on the
"secure element" usually cannot be audited. "Secure element" providers require
NDAs and closed source from the users. As we've seen with
{% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/bitBox2' verdict='true' %}, this
doesn't need to be to the detriment of the product's security: If the security
doesn't rely on the "secure element" but only uses it supplementary, the product
can benefit from added security without putting funds at risk if the "secure
element" is evil.

It turns out a bit hard to find what aspects {{ page.title }} delegates to the
"secure element". Is there a single point of failure?
**Is the masterseed by default generated with entropy solely from the "secure element"?**
If so, the closed source secure element might  be generating backups from poor
randomness that are trivial to recreate by the manufacturer of the chip. *This
would put the product as a whole into our "closed source" category!*

Surprisingly there is no public issue tracker on
[their firmware repository](https://github.com/Coldcard/firmware) neither.
Let's see if we get a reply to
[our question on Twitter](https://twitter.com/LeoWandersleb/status/1425907273029857281).

## Reproducing The Firmware

So the complete [section on Reproducible Builds](https://github.com/Coldcard/firmware#reproducible-builds) is:

> To have confidence this source code tree is the same as the binary on your device,
> you can rebuild it from source and get **exactly the same bytes**. This process
> has been automated using Docker. Steps are as follows:
> 
> 1. Install Docker and start it.
> 2. Install [make (GNUMake)](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) if you don't already have it.
> 3. Checkout the code, and start the process.
>    ```
>    git clone https://github.com/Coldcard/firmware.git
>    cd firmware/stm32
>    make repro
>    ```
> 4. At the end of the process a clear confirmation message is shown, or the differences.
> 5. Build products can be found `firmware/stm32/built`.

Let's see ... we have docker installed and running aka "started" and `make` is
available, too. Let's see what `make repro` would run on our machine first:

which is a scary lot of stuff we are supposed to run on our machine instead of
in a sandbox but it all boils down to those few lines:

```
DOCK_RUN_ARGS = -v $(realpath ..):/work/src:ro \
				-v $(realpath built):/work/built:rw \
				--privileged coldcard-build
	docker build -t coldcard-build - < dockerfile.build
	(cd ..; docker run $(DOCK_RUN_ARGS) sh src/stm32/repro-build.sh)
```

Let's see ...

```
$ docker build --tag coldcard-build - < dockerfile.build
$ DOCK_RUN_ARGS="--volume=$(realpath ..):/work/src:ro --volume=$(realpath built):/work/built:rw --privileged coldcard-build"
$ (cd ..; docker run --rm $DOCK_RUN_ARGS sh src/stm32/repro-build.sh)
...
Need published binary for: 4.1.2

Copy it into ../releases
```

Ok, that did something and as the latest commit looks like it's tagged with the
latest release `v4.1.2`:

```
$ git log -n 1
commit 4f69140ded9168b6a372a37540554e9099e065af (HEAD -> master, tag: 2021-07-28T1347-v4.1.2, origin/master, origin/HEAD)
Author: Peter D. Gray <peter@conalgo.com>
Date:   Wed Jul 28 09:47:37 2021 -0400

    New release: 2021-07-28T1347-v4.1.2
```

we are supposed to re-run this with the published binary in `../releases` ...
relative to where? There is a `../releases` aka `repositoryFolder/releases`  but
there we get the same issue:

```
$ wget https://coldcardwallet.com/downloads/2021-07-28T1347-v4.1.2-coldcard.dfu
$ sha256sum 2021-07-28T1347-v4.1.2-coldcard.dfu 
d01d81305b209dadcf960b9e9d20affb8d4f11e9f9f916c5a06be29298c80dc2  2021-07-28T1347-v4.1.2-coldcard.dfu
$ mv 2021-07-28T1347-v4.1.2-coldcard.dfu ../releases/
$ (cd ..; docker run --rm $DOCK_RUN_ARGS sh src/stm32/repro-build.sh)
...
Need published binary for: 4.1.2

Copy it into ../releases
```

So just to be safe this is not an issue with the shortcut we took by not running
`make repro` and neither an issue with `../releases/` referring to a folder
further up in the hierarchy, we tried with `make repro`, with
`2021-07-28T1347-v4.1.2-coldcard.dfu` in both the existing `firmware/releases`
and a new `firmware/../releases` to no avail. For now, this firmware is
**not verifiable**.

## Update 2021-09-08

With the latest correspondence and updated repo, we give it another try:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Coldcard/firmware.git
$ cd firmware/stm32
$ make repro

This is indeed about what they claimed we should have gotten for the `v4.1.2`
release. So we file `v4.1.3` (this release) as **not reproducible** although the
diff looks harmless but would still like to know how we can check the `v4.1.2`
release as we got no diff at all.

There is more issues with the here presented way of checking a binary: The above
script did not check a binary. It did download a binary which it checked against
the local build. This might be a different binary than the one we wanted to check.

And as explained elsewhere, the analysis if the test we just did actually is a
valid test is considered the responsibility of a proper code review. The code
that runs the test is part of the firmware's repository and our claim is that if
the code is clean then so is the binary, in this case, except for a date string.
