**Update 2023-10-08**: We ran our test script on the latest version:

```
$ ./scripts/test/hardware/coldCard.sh "2023-06-26T1241-v4.1.9" 3
...
 ECDSA Signature: CORRECT
hexdump -C firmware-signed.bin | sed -e 's/^00003f[89abcdef]0 .*/(firmware signature here)/' > repro-got.txt
hexdump -C check-fw.bin | sed -e 's/^00003f[89abcdef]0 .*/(firmware signature here)/' > repro-want.txt
diff repro-got.txt repro-want.txt

SUCCESS.

This is what we hope to see to label this product **reproducible**.

**Update 2023-06-22**: Carl Dong noticed what might be wrong with our build
script. In his
[thread on Twitter](https://twitter.com/carl_dong/status/1671973538029346824)
he also linked to where Coldcard had fixed the issue with the compilation date
leaking into the compilation result.

We updated our test script accordingly and got these results:

```
$ ./scripts/test/hardware/coldCard.sh "2023-06-19T1627-v4.1.8" 3
...
 ECDSA Signature: CORRECT
hexdump -C firmware-signed.bin | sed -e 's/^00003f[89abcdef]0 .*/(firmware signature here)/' > repro-got.txt
hexdump -C check-fw.bin | sed -e 's/^00003f[89abcdef]0 .*/(firmware signature here)/' > repro-want.txt
diff repro-got.txt repro-want.txt
