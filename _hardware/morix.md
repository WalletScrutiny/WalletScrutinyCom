It has fingerprint authentication. 

The card includes an e-paper display to display the QR code for receiving digital assets. The display can also show the balance for the wallet. 

MorixJP is known primarily as a technology specializing in fingerprint sensor technology on various devices. 

There is no mention of mnemonic phrase backup, or the possibility to restore other wallets. The fingerprint sensor is the primary means for transaction confirmation. 

The wallet is reliant on the companion app software. 

As evidenced in this official [MorixJP wallet card video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vi_sM_AyV7A) on Youtube, the **mnemonic phrase is generated and displayed on the mobile phone** and not on the device itself.
