## Background

Rather than a company, Paraleln√≠ Polis embraces cypherpunk culture and is a socio-political movement. The ideals of decentralization and cryptoanarchy are emphasized in this group thus, it aligns with some core tenets of Bitcoin. 

They hold an annual event called the HCPP (Hackers Congress Paraleln√≠ Polis). 

## Description 

A more thorough description could be found in M√°rio Havel's Github [repository.](https://github.com/taxmeifyoucan/HCPP2021-Badge)

> NFC badge contains 2 fields: LNURL-withdraw for paying and LNURL-pay for receiving sats. These are static codes which are created and uploaded only once. To receive funds, user approaches a badge/reads a QR code with LNURL-pay to receive funds from a Bitcoin ATM. Received funds can be immediately spend by reading LNURL-withdraw for example by point of sale terminal. 
>
> LNURL pairs are created using LNbits. Each pair represents a user in LNBits instance. With a web address and user ID, user can easily access web interface of the wallet and manage badge funds there.
>
> Yes, this solution is custodial and involves trusting the LNURL server provider. However, compared to the previous model, it offers the same level of trust. Users can easily withdraw all funds to their own non-custodial wallet, which takes minimum fees and is easy thanks to LNBits feature Drain funds. It also offers security benefits because LNURL-withdraw can be limited to a maximum withdrawal amount, number of uses, and time between them. Privacy benefit - avoiding address reuse and not putting all data onchain is obvious.

> You can find 3 different QR codes on your card. Two codes on the front (white) side are used for payments ‚Äì sending and receiving. Content of these is also on your NFC badge which you can use to interact with ATMs and payment terminals.
>
> Black button allows you to receive funds ‚Äì tap it on ATM while receiving or scan to receive.
>
> Red button ‚Äì send can be used to withdraw funds. Single payment with send code is by default limited to 100k sats
(~40‚Ç¨). For bigger payment, you have to use web wallet interface or
withdraw money to your own wallet.
>
> Third code on the black side of the card is address of your wallet. Scan it and open in your browser to access web application which can be used as Bitcoin Lightning wallet. Application is hosted by Paraleln√≠ Polis which is provider of Lightning infrastructure and liquidity.

## Analysis 

The provider describes the service as **custodial** since the wallet is hosted on a server. If it wasn't custodial, it would still lack a screen to check what is being signed, which is clearly a concern of the provider as they limit payments to 0.001BTC by default.
