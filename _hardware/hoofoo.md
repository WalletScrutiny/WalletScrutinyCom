## Updated Review 2024-10-21

We've since discovered that this project raised money on [indiegogo.](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/hoofoo-the-world-s-first-hackproof-bitcoin-wallet#/)

They were able to raise $67,650 USD by 220 backers.

We looked further down, and see a mess in the comments section:

> I demand a full refund for my pledge amount

and

The website is now unavailable (404). 
This is clearly **vaporware**.

On the [provider's website](https://hoofoo.io/products/hoofoo-hardware-wallet?variant=13765070225526) it states that this hardware wallet is coming soon, so a work in progress.
