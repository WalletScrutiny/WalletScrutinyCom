This product is the PRO version to the {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/bithdrazor' verdict='true' %}

It features a thicker frame and support for Type-C USB.

According to the only linked-to documentation, the device is linked to the {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.bitpie' verdict='true' %}

We were not able to find a new repository apart from the [original BitHD repository](https://github.com/bithd/bithd-mcu). We [tweeted](https://twitter.com/dannybuntu/status/1595323634658476033) what we believe to be the developers of this device.

**Can the private keys be created offline?** 

The device is paired with the {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.bitpie' %} app. **If** the Razor PRO is similar to the Razor, then the mnemonic phrases are displayed on the device after it is paired with the app.

We can see a [demo of this for the Razor on YouTube](https://youtu.be/nGm4_umShlg?t=105). 

**Does the device display the receive address for confirmation?**

[Yes.](https://youtu.be/fMlNiXK_71k?t=109)

**Does the device have both input and output?"**

Yes.

Input: 2 Buttons
Output: Screen (OLED 128*64)

The product does not offer a link to a different repository. Until such time that the developers respond to our [question on twitter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1595341363150671872), we would have to assume that the firmware for the Razor Pro is different from the Razor, and is therefore not yet publicly available.
