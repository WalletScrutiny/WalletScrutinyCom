## Product Description from [a third-party website](https://cryptoage.com/en/1886-magic-seed-encrypted-storage-of-seed-phrases-from-crypto-wallets.html)

> Seed phrase is a set of randomly selected words, with the help of which you can restore access to today's cryptowallets. The number of words can be from 10 or more, so remembering these words and their order is quite problematic. Because of this, the seed phrase is usually duplicated on paper or a text document. This approach solves the problem of remembering complex seed phrases, but at the same time, the chance of losing control of your cryptocurrency savings under various external influences increases for reasons independent of you. To maximize the storage of seed phrases, MagicSeed is developing a device with the same name that will store your Seed phrases in encrypted form.
>
> The idea of the Magic Seed device is very simple - it encrypts a phrase up to 24 words in one word (password), which the user can easily remember. Thus, you can access the seed phrase only by knowing the code word and having the device in your hands, which complicates the theft of cryptocurrency as much as possible. Another important difference from other crypto wallets is that Magicseed works without an Internet connection and, accordingly, remote hacking of such a wallet is completely excluded.

## How it would have worked

**Taken from the [FAQs](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/magicseed#/faq)**

> What does MagicSeed do with my seed?<br />
> Nothing. The seed is encrypted with an offline process and no information are stored on the device. We don’t store your seed and no one can hack the device because it’s not connected anywhere.
>
> How can I recover my original seed if MagicSeed is not working?<br />
> For your security, we strongly encourage you to recover your seed offline, so using our MagicSeed device it’s always the best option. In order to let our backers recover their seeds in an emergency case, we will create an online service to let you decrypt your QR code
>
> How does the QR code custody service work?<br />
> We are developing a custody service of the QR code to help you and your loved ones recover it in case of emergency. We are really looking for our backers feedbacks and opinions in order to give them the best products and services they really need at an affordable price.

## Analysis

We viewed the [IndieGogo page](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/magicseed#/) and found that {{ page.title }} had not met its goal by the deadline. Out of their target of 50,000 EUR, they were only able to raise 7,711 EUR. The campaign is now closed.

Here is an [archived version of the website](https://web.archive.org/web/20210123192104/https://magicseed.io/) from 2019. {{ page.title }} was promoted as an *upcoming product,* with the website also saying that pre-order would soon be available on IndieGogo.

As of today, this website does not exist anymore.

This gives us reason to conclude that as the wallet's production has been cancelled, it is qualifiable as **vaporware.**
