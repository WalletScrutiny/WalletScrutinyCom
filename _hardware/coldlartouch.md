## [Official User Manual](https://www.coldlar.com/en/help/manual)
Requires an Android companion app [downloadable](https://www.coldlar.com/en/download) through the provider's website.

## Updated Review 2024-12-09

The website is online once more and [updated](https://www.coldlar.com/en/announcement/10000002?type=1).

According to the manual: 

- Uses randomly generate mnemonics
- Private keys for different coins are derived from mnemonics
- Hardware cold wallet (offline end) handles digital signatures
- ColdLar software App (network end) handles transaction building and broadcasting
- NFC ensures private keys never touch the internet
- Card can be reset

The verdict for this device regarding its **lack of an interface**, is unchanged.


## Updated Review 2022-11-26

The primary domain coldlar.com is no longer online. However, a possible clone or duplicate site, hengshengjia.com is still online. We asked on [twitter](https://twitter.com/dannybuntu/status/1596363404440383488) whether this is an official site and we await their response.

From the clone website, it appears the device is supposed to be connected via NFC to an already non-existing Google Play app with id=com.coldlar.hotwallet. The APK is available via third party websites. The update for the app is dated May 29, 2020. 

Pending the reply on twitter, there are many indications that this product is already defunct. The previous verdict indicating there is no interface stands. 

## Previous Review 2022-03-23

Without a screen and without a button, this device cannot provide basic security of hardware wallets.
