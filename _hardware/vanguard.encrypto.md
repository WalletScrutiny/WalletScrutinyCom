>  [The Vanguard Encrypto](https://www.franckmuller.com/vanguard-encrypto-) also called “the world’s first functional Bitcoin watch” is our newly launched limited edition. The dial includes a laser-etched QR code for a public wallet address that can be used to deposit Bitcoins and check the balance of the account. To allow this secure process, a sealed USB stick is included with the watch to store the private key.

{{ page.title }} is a watch that is designed to hold bitcoin. The product is shipped with a sealed USB meant to contain the private key. A public address is laser-etched on its face.

From the [FAQ](https://franckmullerencrypto.com/faq/) page:

> To be able to move the funds, you must push a pin through the hole marked on the back of the USB. <br />
Once that is done, the private key will be revealed. Once unsealed, you will have access to your private key. <br />
Then, you’ll need to link your private key to the live wallet.

Because the QR code is already etched on the watch and the USB needs to be "unsealed" to gain access to the private keys. However, **to avoid having to trust the provider with the private key**,  users may order "an unused sealed USB" and submit a public address of their choice to have etched on the watch dial.

As for how the watch's interface functions, there does not seem to be a way to verify or approve transactions on this device:

> **How to transfer bitcoins through my Franck Muller Watch dial?** <br />
Open any live wallet software or web-based wallet and send or receive funds from any live wallet to the public address shown on your watch dial.

Additionally:

> Claiming the funds from the set happens at the USB or cold wallet level and is not related to your time piece, and this requires software. This software is usually referred to as a “live wallet”, which should not be confused with your off-line USB or cold wallet.

This product lacks the interface to be able to make or confirm its own transactions.
