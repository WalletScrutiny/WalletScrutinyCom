[The most recent (2019-01-24) review on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLI3BEBASPDRJ/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07JHMDV9X) claims that this wallet "seems to have been abandoned and no longer works properly."

We checked the website, and [on the homepage](https://flxwallet.com/index-en.html) we found this notice:

> **Effective 12/03/2021, FLX Wallet support is no longer available.** FLX Wallet can be recovered to any crypto wallet with the 24-word phrases (during initial setup).

This product is discontinued.
