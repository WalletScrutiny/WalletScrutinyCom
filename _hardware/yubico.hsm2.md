## Analysis 

As Jimmy Song [noted](https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/925971027816882176), the device has the "potential" to be at least a bitcoin transaction signing device. That tweet was made in 2017, and since then no significant development has been made to further this push. At the price of $650 USD, it is comparatively costlier than the "average" personal cryptocurrency hardware wallet.

Secondly, it has no display or buttons to allow potential users (should the feature be introduced) to confirm transactions. 

As it is, the device **does not serve as a wallet**.
