## Product Description 

From Anish Athalye's [Notary page](https://www.anish.io/notary/):

> Notary is a new hardware and software architecture for running isolated approval agents in the form factor of a USB stick with a small display and buttons. Approval agents allow factoring out critical security decisions, such as getting the user’s approval to sign a Bitcoin transaction or to delete a backup, to a secure environment. The key challenge addressed by Notary is to securely switch between agents on the same device. Prior systems either avoid the problem by building single-function devices like a USB U2F key, or they provide weak isolation that is susceptible to kernel bugs, side channels, or Rowhammer-like attacks. Notary achieves strong isolation using reset-based switching, along with the use of physically separate systems-on-a-chip for agent code and for the kernel, and a machine-checked proof of both the hardware’s register-transfer-level design and software, showing that reset-based switching leaks no state. Notary also provides a trustworthy I/O path between the agent code and the user, which prevents an adversary from tampering with the user’s screen or buttons.
>
> We built a hardware/software prototype of Notary, using a combination of ARM and RISC-V processors. The prototype demonstrates that it is feasible to verify Notary’s reset-based switching, and that Notary can support diverse agents, including cryptocurrencies and a transaction approval agent for traditional client-server applications such as websites. Measurements of reset-based switching show that it is fast enough for interactive use. We analyze security bugs in existing cryptocurrency hardware wallets, which aim to provide a similar form factor and feature set as Notary, and show that Notary’s design avoids many bugs that affect them.

## Analysis 

As far as we can tell, the device has **not been released commercially**. We [reached out to Anish via twitter](https://twitter.com/dannybuntu/status/1514192538756087812) to confirm whether the device was released commercially.

This was the reply: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes! We&#39;ve been building end-to-end (hardware+software) formally verified hardware security modules, starting with examples simpler than crypto wallets. We have an upcoming OSDI&#39;22 paper; if you want to see a preprint, please email me</p>&mdash; Anish Athalye (@anishathalye) <a href="https://twitter.com/anishathalye/status/1514240904252469260?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 13, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
