## Update 2025-02-06

We were not able to find the version number for the firmware, but found 2 clues: 

1. The device's firmware is updated through the app. This is indicated in the {% include walletLink.html wallet='iphone/com.ecomi.securewallet' verdict='true' %} app store changelog for version 2.2.0

  > Features
  > - Multiple wallet support (Pair additional wallets from the settings page)
  > - Secure Wallet firmware update

2. We will match the version number of firmware with the latest version of the app, which was last updated on [June 20, 2024.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ecomi-secure-wallet/id1432655565?ls=1)

## Previous Review 2024-11-15

ECOMI's Secure Wallet was announced on May 7, 2018 through [bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3609319).

Its hardware is powered by CoolBitX, the same manufacturer for the CoolWalletS bitcoin hardware wallet.

The card communicates via BlueTooth with a companion app. {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.ecomi' verdict='true' %}

It has the following components: 

- E-paper Display
- LED Indicator
- Secure Element
- Power / Confirmation button
- Charging Terminals 
- Wireless Connector

A video introduction of the product is [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrPMcet8Tl0).

The recovery seed were initially in the form of numbers. A later update allowed users to convert to an alphabetical seed. 

It should be noted that the seed phrases are generated and later on confirmed, on the companion app on the phone.

Like the CoolWalletS, 

> the private key has to be brought onto a different system that doesnâ€™t necessarily share all the desired aspects of a hardware wallet.
