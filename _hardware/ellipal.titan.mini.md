The device is notably airgapped. The only method for it to update is by downloading the firmware unto a Micro SD card which is then plugged into the device. 

## Analysis 

The firmware updates are available for [download from Ellipal's website](https://download.ellipal.com/coldwallet/Ellipal_mini_v1.1.0.zip) but we could not find the source code of the firmware. This product is **not verifiable**.
