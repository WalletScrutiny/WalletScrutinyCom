## Analysis 

The unboxing video from ORE System shows a CoolWallet Pro box. But the card inside shows the branding of the ORE System.

As indicated in the {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/coolwalletpro' verdict='true' %} review, the firmware is not publicly available. 

We'd like to add that the device pairs with a mobile app. We've asked ORE System via Telegram whether their device pairs with the following apps or if they have their own: 

* Android {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.coolbitx.cwsapp' %}
* iPhone {% include walletLink.html wallet='iphone/com.coolbitx.coolwallets' %}

CoolBitX (the manufacturer of the CoolWalletPro) disclosed in December 18, 2020, that the device has a [vulnerability](https://www.coolwallet.io/bluetooth-security-vulnerability-seed-replay-attack/) related to its Bluetooth pairing. The vulnerability exists given the following conditions: 

> 1. If a user uses the basic wallet creation and wallet recovery functions through an outdated app version.
> 2. If a malicious actor is physically within 30 meters of you and your CoolWallet at that time.
> 3. If the bad actor has prepared a second CoolWallet to intercept private information. 

This has since been patched. The url for this article describes this as a "Seed Replay Attack", which can only be executed provided the 3 conditions above are met. 

While the [Javascript SDK](https://github.com/CoolBitX-Technology/coolwallet-sdk) for the CoolWallet Pro is available on their GitHub repositories, we were not able to find the firmware's repository.
