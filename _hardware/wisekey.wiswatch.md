## Background 

Initially, we were expecting an actual device - or an actual watch that functions like a cryptocurrency hardware wallet. We were a bit confused when the home url for the wiswatch, redirected to its parent company's homepage. We then saw NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and a luxury watch authentication platform that is devoid of the features of a hardware wallet. 

We came to a realization that the product may have been discontinued or re-branded to something else. [Archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20160208062524/http://www.wis.watch/) paints a totally different description of the device compared with what the [current page](https://www.wisekey.com/wiswatch/) for the {{ page.title }} portrays today.  

## Product Description 

This video of the {{ page.title }} was made 6 years ago.

We would be describing the "original" {{ page.title }} as it was described in 2018: 

> WIS.WATCH allows contactless transactions highly secured with bitcoin or other cryptocurrency payments. WIS.WATCH is provided with a WISeCoin Wallet Companion App.
>
> - Access to the WISeCoin Wallet
> - Embedded Near Field Communication ("NFC" Technology")
> - Fingerprint, face recognition, dot pattern and password options
> - Enabling to trade bitcoin or other crypto currencies across different multiple wallets
> - Easy to use, encrypted device storage for all your digital assets like Contacts Documents Medias
> - 1 Terabyte of swiss ultra-secure storage for 12 months

## Verdict 

We tweeted [WISekey](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1518487520904101888) to find out the real status of the {{ page.title }}. However at this juncture, we believe that the device has been discontinued or re-branded to suit what's more trending today. The price tag of 499CHF, and the radical downtrend of Bitcoin's price in 2018 may have led WISekey to change what the WISekey wiswatch was all about. Until we receive a reply from them, we would be designating this item as **vaporware**.
