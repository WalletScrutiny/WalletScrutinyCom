- SafePal X1 takes on a design more similar to a calculator; an interface that includes a screen and buttons. This allows users to view transaction details on the wallet.
- It uses the Secure Chip EAL5+ and can connect to external devices either through USB or Bluetooth.
- Its companion app is {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/io.safepal.wallet' verdict='true' %} for android and {% include walletLink.html wallet='iphone/walletapp.safepal.io' verdict='true' %} for iPhone along with a few extensions for browser use [here.](https://www.safepal.com/extension) 

Although we found a repository named "safepal-x1" we didn't find a complete README, build instructions, or even confirmation that this is in fact the official safepal-x1 firmware. Until further updates, this product is also **non-verifiable.**

We sent them a friendly note on their GitHub [issues page](https://github.com/SafePalWallet/safepal-x1/issues/1).
