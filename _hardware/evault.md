We found a YouTube channel with a tutorial with the name of "[Evault YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF8PitFzRAa7pUPFBwwhECw)". The channel lists evaultcompany.com as the home page for the Evault hardware wallet. There is currently no website on the domain although it has been registered on March 27, 2018. It will expire on 2024. 

From the Youtube video, we determine that the wallet is compatible with the Exodus wallet.

## Product Description

> Exodus software is at the heart of every EVault (Jaxx & Copay support coming soon); giving the option to current Exodus users to convert their wallet into an even more secure, portable, hardware version.
>
> You control your private keys and you control access to your wallets. We do not hold your private keys or keep your wallet online;

## Verdict

Judging from this [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqTK2l7_Ego), the Evault is reliant on the Exodus software. Without the website description and technical specifications, we can only assume the evidence we've gathered from the Youtube video. The device when plugged to the computer via a USB port allows the user to somewhat duplicate and run Exodus on the device. The manufacturers claim that the private key is secured on the device. A jar file is executed and Exodus subsequently runs on the Evault device with the same public address. 

The device has no display wherein the user can confirm transactions. 

We did not find buttons on the device from the picture or the videos.
