**⚠️ Note:** There are multiple serious allegations on Blackarrow Software's available social media accounts including Facebook and bitcointalk.  

[A Reddit post from r/Bitcoin in 2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2ygong/ewallet_trezor_compatible_hardware_wallet_just/) stated that eWallet was "just released."

It's presumed that Black Arrow Software, the company providing this product, is no longer active. The official website is down and the Twitter account hasn't seen any activity since 2017.

Here is [an archived version of the product's page.](https://web.archive.org/web/20191116164822/http://www.blackarrowsoftware.com/store/ewallet.html) From the description:

> This is a hardware wallet designed to protect your Bitcoins.
>
> eWallet is a lot better than a paper wallet, better than banking security. It effectively provides best protection in the industry. It produces a paper wallet for backup that can be used to restore your coins should the device fail or get lost.

An image from the page shows that the user would have been able to sign transactions on the hardware device as well as allow the user to confirm the address where the cryptocurrency would be sent.

Below are the advertised features:

> - 100% Trezor compatible, can be updated from mytrezor.com with the latest firmware.  
> - Truly wearable: it does not require a cable to connect to your laptop and smaller than Trezor.
> - Open source code
> - Can be safely used on a infected computer even with a keylogger installed
> - This wallet never exposes the private keys to the outside world to keep your coins always safe.
> - All transactions are signed by the wallet.
> - Embedded screen ensures that you sign the transaction that you really intend to.

## Verdict

The company has a [seriously extensive history](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=105804) when it comes to the bitcoin community. There were allegations that Black Arrow Software merely [copied the Trezor firmware](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=983471.msg10825751#msg10825751) and altered the bootloader and the license.  

As it uses Trezor's firmware, we have to assume that this wallet was also able to generate keys offline and sign transactions. Using Trezor's firmware does not make this product fake (as Trezor's license allows clones), but it should be noted that there's no available source code for this product which would be a **violation of [Trezor's license](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/blob/master/LICENSE.md)**. If the firmware was modified in some way the users would have been unable to view the changes.

From [a blogpost in 2015](http://www.stellaw.info/blog/2015/3/18/black-arrow-ewallets-arrives) that reviewed this wallet:

> Initial impressions leave me confident that they have made modifications and customizations to Trezor code that they have not yet published.

This product **does not have any source code available for review.**

With the site down and the company's social media inactive, we have to assume that this product is now **defunct.**
