## Product Description 

The UKISS Hugware® is comprised of a pair of USB devices, the A-Key and the R-Key. The A-Key or the Authentication Key, [generates](https://youtu.be/dIAsYM53vVY?t=19) and stores private keys and authenticates transactions. The R-Key or the Rescue Key, resets passwords and restores the A-Key. UKISS is also slated to release the UKISS Suite which will add some features to the Hugware®: 

- Crypto swaps 
- Liquidity mining
- NFT trading
- Staking
- Yield farming 

Integrated Digital Security Solutions

- Data encryption
- Password management
- Ransomware protection
- Secure social messaging

UKISS also makes the claim that the recovery words are [deliberately eliminated](https://youtu.be/NRT8Eg5-TkI?t=117) from use in the device. We asked them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1503630819726073859) if it was possible if they can share the product specification sheet and whether the project is Open Source.

As of today March 15, 2022, the UKISS hugware is still in the middle of its soft launch. The site still asks for an email address for **Pre-Order discounts and promos**. Documentation, tutorials and other technical information such as private key generation are still not readily available online.
