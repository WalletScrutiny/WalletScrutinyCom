## Analysis 

As the direct manufacturer of such cards, no mention has been made specifically accommodating Bitcoin. Rather, its blog posts and product descriptions talk about CBDCs and digital currency in general. Cryptocurrencies were mentioned but in a general way which is not specifically instructive about its product lines. Bitcoin was not specifically mentioned. 

As much as we believe that these cards could - based on their general description, serve as Bitcoin wallets, the company does not make this specific. What is real is that it mentions that they have a device that is a:

> This is a hardware wallet, specifically a digital currency hardware wallet based on a dual-interface 1C card, and an instant peer-to-peer method using cryptocurrency using contactless technology.  

The card does not come with any branding or programming, meaning that it is up to the clients to make these products into CBDC or BTC wallets or something else that is not a wallet. We conclude that this product is **not intended to serve as a bitcoin wallet**.
