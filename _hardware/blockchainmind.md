## Analysis

We could not find any description about its wallet, so we asked on [twitter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1526390711293071361). Searching for "blockchainmind hardware wallet", we find that it has in its search result description the following: 

> BlockchainMind Inc got Incorporated in Canada and developed a prototype hardware wallet.

We could not find a page detailing the specifications for this hardware wallet. 

Until they reply, we would go by their self-description that the hardware wallet is a "prototype" and hence **not yet released**.
