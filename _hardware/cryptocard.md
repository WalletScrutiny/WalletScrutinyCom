## Analysis 

{{ page.title }} had a short [YouTube demonstration.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EJBRUYfPiw) Checking the channel that posted this video, we found one other [upload](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRrSz6__2lU) which was a promo of the {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/slimtech.cryptolite' verdict='true' %}. 

 Although the channel may be associated with slimTECH gear, this singular video concerning {{ page.title }} doesn't list a brand name or provide a website. We also searched for clearer images of the card online but did not find relevant results.
 
 As there's no indication that this card was ever up for sale, we have to assume that it can be qualified as **vaporware.**
