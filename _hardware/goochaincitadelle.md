Goochain's website is no longer available. It would appear that this service has been in existence prior to offering its Citadelle hardware wallet with the same name. Goochain was presented in October 2, 2014 as the "[Google for Bitcoin](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=808066.0)" or some sort of blockchain explorer. It made an [announcement](https://twitter.com/Goochain/status/659016578802044928) about its Citadelle hardware wallet through twitter on October 27, 2015. Further information about the wallet was discussed via a French version of [an archived page of newsbtc](https://web.archive.org/web/20171229135231/http://fr.newsbtc.com:80/presentation-du-hardware-wallet-citadelle/).

By August 2, 2019, Goochain's twitter account announced that it would henceforth be known as @blkhub, which pinned a post about an "[open-source bitcoin mining calculator](https://twitter.com/a_ferron/status/1360181210580979718)". 

We could not find a lot of information about the Goochain Citadelle wallet apart from it has a companion [Google Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/goochain-citadelle-wallet/belpokalcjbcjcfggbgmgaiblldgkadn) that allowed the creation of Bitcoin wallets. The description of the Chrome extension says that it can interface with a Trezor hardware wallet through USB. 

An article from finder.com.au, mentioned that Goochain's operations "wound up" because of [supplier problems](https://www.finder.com.au/a-brief-history-of-cryptocurrency-hardware-wallets).

We couldn't find evidence of this product ever having been for sale and assume it's **vaporware**.
