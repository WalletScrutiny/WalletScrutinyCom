## Background

The {{ page.title }} was featured in [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1033670017/cryptotestament) on January 19, 2017. It was not successfully funded and ended on February 18, 2017. The domain cryptotestament is no longer available and is for sale. 

## Product Information 

> CryptoTestament bridges the gap between estate laws, which grant families access to digital data, and privacy laws, which prohibit access, after a family member has passed away so digital legacies — passwords, important digital files and cryptocurrencies — are easily recoverable by heirs.
> 
CryptoTestament uses AES 256-bit encryption with a manageable console allowing CryptoTestament to unlock the device after death. AES stands for ‘Advanced Encryption Standard’, which is an encryption technology standard created by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and all of your data will be encrypted with strong algorithms to protect against brute force, malware and spyware attacks. The USB-style encrypted device is available in 8GB, 16GB and 32GB sizes and uses the same certification used by the NSA and other government agencies.  
> 
When you input data into our system, it goes through the encrypted device first so the data that we upload to our cloud is already in the encrypted, secure format. Our cloud is hidden, thus the only way in which the data can be accessed is with the help of a private tunnel between the user device and the cloud.
> 
When you pledge to CryptoTestament, you automatically get a full year of the Safeguard Plan. If you would like additional years of coverage, you can add those on at a cost $30.00 per year. Here are the additional benefits you receive with Safeguard Plan:

**Other Features**
>
- Remote lockdown. If your device is lost or stolen you can lock it down remotely. 
- Searchability. A search feature to find the device if it’s lost or stolen. 
- Cloud Access. Access to the encrypted CryptoTestament Cloud Services. 
- Asset delivery. CryptoTestament makes it easier on your heirs when you pass away. We will contact the executor of your will, do all of the legal paperwork to make sure the assets are transferred legally and your heirs will have no out-of-pocket expense to obtain your digital assets.

## Analysis 

The service consists of a USB device and access to a cloud-based service - what is calls its "Safeguard Plan". Since it was not funded, the website has gone offline. The project was **discontinued and never heard of again**.
