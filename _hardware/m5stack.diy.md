This wallet is not in active production or sale, and instead seems to be an experimental project. Code for the wallet [can be found in Github](https://github.com/stepansnigirev/m5stack_hardware_wallet) and was created by [stepansnigirev](https://github.com/stepansnigirev). This code is meant to be flashed onto an M5Stack ESP32 board.
