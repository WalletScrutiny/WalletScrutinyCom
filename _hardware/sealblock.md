## Description

> [SealBlock™ hardware wallet](https://sealblock.io/#dom03) uses next generation of hardware encryption technology (Intel SGX) to build a physical crypto boundary for a trusted execution environment. Private keys and signing policy are sealed within SGX Secure Enclave and signings are performed within the Enclave, in order to ensure that the entire process is safe and controllable under the condition that the digital signing function continues to be online, and can achieve a level of defense even against rogue administrators.

There is an associated token for the project called the SKT token. It is currently marked as [inactive](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/sealblock-token) by coingecko.com. Furthermore, most of sealblock's social media activity ceased on 2019.

## Verdict 

From {{ page.title }}'s [FAQ](https://sealblock.io/faqs/): 

> SealBlock™ currently supports Ethereum and tokens using the ERC-20 standard. Support of BTC and other coins are in development.

Metamask is required to login to SealBlock. 

To add to our belief that Sealblock is no longer being marketed, the Telegram account that was addressing user concerns on Telegram has already been deleted. Together with the lack of an option to purchase the {{ page.title }} device, lead us to conclude that this project is **vaporware.**
