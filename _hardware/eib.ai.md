**⚠️ Warning:** First [launched](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4363233.0) on May 30, 2018, the project held an ICO. EIB is an ERC-223 token on the Ethereum Network. The site is inaccessible for us. Most social media content ceased posting content in 2019. 

## Analysis

There is **no evidence the product existed commercially**.
