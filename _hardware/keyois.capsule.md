> You can put funds into it but you need to break it apart to spend the funds.
It's hard to break apart so it's tamper-resistant and tamper-evident. It won't burn, rot, rust, melt, or otherwise lose data where so many other types of cold storage would.

According to the post, the main goal behind this product was to have a durable "hardware wallet" that wouldn't be easily damaged by fire or water.

> A backup seed or private key can be printed on paper or stored digitally but these mediums can be damaged by fire, time, water, and much more. Not everyone can have the perfect backup procedure and this is great if you don't have land or need something to last a long time.
To be fair there are cheaper ways to improve your own situation, including: stamping or engraving on a piece of steel and securing that from wandering eyes; but this is super stylish.

The original poster, [aolley](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=407182) was last active on the forum [and on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/ProfBitcoin/) in 2018.

r/Keyois, a subreddit linked in the post, has been banned due to being unmoderated. The Keyois site has nothing to do with the wallet and is now full of potentially malicious pop-up ads. With no shop or site, we have to assume that this project is inactive.

## Analysis 

> Your BIP38 encrypted Secret Key (or otherwise encrypted backup seed) in engraved into a titanium ring.    
That is set inside another ring that bears the address.    
That is then put into a tamper evident and air-tight capsule with a elegant centerpiece of lab-created ruby or sapphire.  

and: 

> You must supply me with an address and a BIP38 encrypted secret key / encrypted seed. Because of this these items are not recommended for novices.

While the keys aren't "prefilled" the user would have still depended on external devices that aren't secure and cannot approve or make transactions. 
 
This product is **defunct** along with the manufacturer in charge of it.
