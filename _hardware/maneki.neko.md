## Product Description 

The project is fairly new. [Token information](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/the-neko) started in the first quarter of 2022.

The project is aiming to co-develop a hardware wallet with a *"leading blockchain security company"*. 

It is primarily related to NFTs and DeFi.

The project has its own ERC-20 token. 

## Analysis 

We asked on their Telegram about the specifications for the device and they claim that this information is currently not being shared with others. 

Until such time new information is available, we determine the hardware wallet as **not yet released.**
