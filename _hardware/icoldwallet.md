## Verdict 

There is no specification whether the private key leaves the hardware wallet once it interfaces with the mobile device. The promotional material mentions that the private key is encrypted but there was no further elaboration on this. 

It also has **no interface or a display**. Although it mentions that transactions are confirmed on the hardware wallet, it does not specify exactly how. Without any noticeable buttons or displays, we take this statement with a bit of skepticism. What we can see is that it is **reliant on the mobile phone app**.
