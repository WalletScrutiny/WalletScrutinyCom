**Update 2024-12-08:** The support page link mentioned below is now defunct and there is no hint at this product still existing but if it's a Ledger, it probably will still work as such ...

This hardware wallet is a rebrand of a {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/ledgerNanoS' verdict=true %}.

It seems this hardware wallet is discontinued but it still has support pages available on [blockchain.com](https://support.blockchain.com/hc/en-us/categories/360001092591-Lockbox).

The product might be {% include verdictBadge.html verdict='stale' type='short' %}
or even {% include verdictBadge.html verdict='obsolete' type='short' %} but we
give it the benefit of the doubt and assume it works with the original Ledger
firmware and its updates which is still closed source and thus **not verifiable**.
