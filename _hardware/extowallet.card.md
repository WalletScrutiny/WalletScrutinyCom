From their [page](https://www.extowallet.com/product-page/extowallet-card):

> - Secure means of creating and storing your private crypto keys
- On-card fingerprint recognition and Pin input
- Navigation touch wheel
- E-ink display 
- Secure Bluetooth connectivity
- Built-in NFC and USB connecvity
- Rechargerable battery
- USB charging cradle and cable

They also [claim](https://www.extowallet.com/) that the smart card also has an EMV chip and 'easy' multi-signature cosigning through the device and a mobile phone: 

> Multi-signature Crypto Wallets are known to be the safest way to keep custody of crypto-currencies. But they have been difficult to set up and therefore not used other than by expert users or institutional custodians and exchanges. ExtoWallet is the first crypto wallet that enables easy to use cosigning, with one key on the ExtoCard and a second on your iOS or Android smartphone.
>
> Both devices are required to cosign all transactions using multi-sig features native to the crypto asset, leading to unparalleled security. (Bitcoin Cash, ETH & ERC20 cosigning coming soon).
>
> The ExtoCard utilizes on-card fingerprint recognition or pin and the ExtoWallet App utilizes iOS/Android biometric access or pin for multi-factor authentication. 

**Mnemonic Recovery is Possible** 

> The display and touch navigation allow secure on card recovery of wallets using 12 keywords.

Furthermore, they also claim that the ExtoWallet App is Open Source. However, **we were not able to find a link from their site to a repository**. A search on Google Play also did not yield the described app. We were able to find the iPhone app {% include walletLink.html wallet='iphone/com.extolab.extowallet' verdict='true' %}. They [tried to launch a Kickstarter](https://twitter.com/Exto_Labs/status/1303431396044800004) campaign for the Android app, but there was no word on what transpired after.
