## Product Description 

A card that stores your private key and connects to your phone via NFC. It also claims to use an "Embedded EAL6+ SecureCore microchip by Samsung."

The companion app has been reviewed and can be found here: {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.ttmbank.wallet.app' verdict='true' %}

> The embedded chip creates and holds your unique and uncopyable key within the card, making it the most secure way to store your crypto.


## Analysis 

The device itself is an NFC card that relies on the companion app to make transactions.
