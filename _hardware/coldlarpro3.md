## Private keys can be created offline - ✔️

From the [Licensing Agreement](https://www.coldlar.com/licenargument):

> “Cold wallet” refers to the wallet product that stores the private keys of digital asset and does not connect the internet.

This is an offline wallet.

> Recovery phrase” refers to 12 (or 15/18/21/24) ordered words generated by random algorithm that meet the industry standard of block chain BIP39. It is an easy-to-record form of private key, convenient to backup and safekeeping for the User. It is also known as “seed password” in some ColdLar wallet products.

Users are also told to backup the recovery phrase in a safe place on paper.

> It is suggested that the user transcribe the recovery phrase the paper backup card tailored by ColdLar and keep it properly. And for recovery phrase, it is specially noted that **the User is prohibited to input the electronic version on any web page, transmit it via network-based means, photograph it with mobile phone and store it (including but not limited to: screenshot, e-mail, Notebook in mobile phone, short message, WeChat and QQ).**

## Private keys are not shared - ✔️

Coldlar also states that it has no access to the private keys.

> The products provided by ColdLar do not store the recovery phrase and passwords of users, so they cannot help retrieve the recovery phrase and passwords.

## Interface

We see in the [promotional video](https://www.coldlar.com/productDetails/10062) that this hardware wallet supposedly has a screen interface.

## Reproducibility

There was no mention of source code, other than this section on the same Licensing Agreement, Article 4.3:

> Without the explicit written authorization and consent of ColdLar, the User shall not copy, translate, decompose, reversely compile, disassemble, reversely engineer the licensing software or any part thereof in any way, or attempt to export the program source code from the licensing software, or write or develop derivative software, derivatives or other software based on the licensing software.

Coldlar does not have a link to any Github repository. It does not advertise itself as an open-source product.

We conclude that there is **no publicly available source for verification.**
