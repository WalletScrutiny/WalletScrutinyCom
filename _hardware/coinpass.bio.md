## Analysis 

The [CoinPass Bio](https://www.ftsafe.com/article/538.html) was announced in 2016. Back then, Feitian Technologies Ltd. announced that it was the first hardware wallet they released. Currently, the {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/jubiterblade' verdict='true' %} - another Feitian product, is more widely found in search results. Images of the CoinPass Bio may have been scrubbed from the site and we were only able to acquire renderings via Google cache. 

If the product has indeed been released, then pictures of it would be more widely available on various search engines. The only pictures we managed to find are from press releases and not from actual product pages. The lack of a hardware specification sheet as well as a checkout option, lend us to believe that this product has been superseded by something else. As such, we are classifying this as **vaporware**.
