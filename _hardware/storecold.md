## General Overview

Apart from its website, there is no other information about this hardware wallet. We could not find any twitter accounts or mentions of the product. There is no news or publicity about its release. There is no company information. Clicking on "Legal Action" on its homepage redirects to its homepage. We also could not find any reviews on YouTube.

## Products 

The site lists 4 products, of which only one can be "ordered". The others are out of stock, and one redirects to the homepage. 

The one available is the Store Cold Nova X9. Before you can order, you must first contact the provider via its contact form. We find this to be irregular because providers who usually keep stock of their items, have an automated ordering process.

All of the items have the same picture and they distinguish them by some "BTC size"? Here's a brief summary of the products:  

- Storecold Tera X10 - the order button redirects to the homepage. They call this "Size 32 BTC" - for $450
- Storecold Tera X213 - Out of Stock - "Size 8BTC" - $199 
- Storecold Nova X9 - can be ordered [here](https://www.storecold.io/checkout.html) after filling out a web form - "Size 22BTC" - $350 USD
- Storecold Nano X3 - Out of Stock - "Size 4BTC" - $270

## The Storecold Nova X9

The product description on the website reads:

> Install and manage more than 250 crypto applications and tokens at the same time.
>
> It connects to iOS, Android & desktop computers. It keeps private keys separate from vulnerable, internet-connected devices.Your all-important private keys are maintained in a secure offline environment on the hardware wallet, fully protected even should the device be plugged into a malware-infected computer.

## Features Page 

StoreCold's [Features](https://www.storecold.io/index.html#features) Page, seems to apply to all of its claimed models.

> Multiple cryptocurrency support
> Supports Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ripple, Ethereum, ERC-20, and many more. Continuously adding new assets.
>
> Effortless Exchanges
> Quickly exchange cryptocurrencies via the ShapeShift integration, directly from your wallet.
>
> Secure private key management
> Storecold features standalone secure key generation without the need of external software or a host device.

## Verdict 

The overall presentation of the website plus the social media presence (or lack thereof) seem to indicate that this is an **unreleased** product. We emailed them to be sure and await their feedback. 

Given the page [is around since October 2020](https://www.whois.com/whois/storecold.io) there is remarkably little to be found about this product.
