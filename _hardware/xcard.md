**Warning:** The founders of the XCard Project held an ICO sometime in 2018. The site for the ICO, xcard.io is no longer available but is accessible via [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20190110001829/http://xcard.io/). The associated token for this project is the MBM, an ERC-20 token.

## Product Description

The claims:

> - multi-signature cold-storage wallet
- biometric card "made together with VISA"
- card is available after signing up to XCARD Wallet.
- multi-asset wallet with 150 fiat currencies, and top 30 cryptocurrencies
- securities based on blockchain technology
- eCommerce payment services
- instant asset exchange
- enables trading with over 200 cryptocurrencies

It says on the 'Road map' that full platform rollout was supposed to commence on the second quarter of 2019. The Android and iPhone XCARD wallet app was also supposed to go live on the same time period.

## Verdict 

The social media presence of Mobilum and the CEO, Wojtek Kaszycki are still active. Mobilum was [100% acquired](TechX Signs Definitive Agreement to Acquire Mobilum, a Digital Wallet and Payment Technology Gateway) by Tech X on May 26, 2021 for C$16,000,000.   

> In addition to the payment processing technology, TechX will gain access to Mobilum's Xcard digital wallet technology platform. The wallet is expected to launch in Q3 of 2021.

Two months later, [TechX changed its name to Mobilum](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/techx-announces-effective-date-of-name-change-301337684.html): 

> Effective at the opening on Wednesday, July 21, 2021, the shares of the Company will commence trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange under the name "Mobilum Technologies Inc." and stock symbol "MBLM".

Mobilum Technologies, Inc. has since refocused its efforts on "Payment Processing Technology for Crypto Businesses" which is possibly related to XCard, but not the XCard that was described in its ICO in 2018. **Though the company still exists today, there is no proof that XCard does**. We have no proof it has, but not with the same branding and not with the same premise.
