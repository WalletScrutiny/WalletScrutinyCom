## Product Description 

The HashWallet Link is included in the latest update for a different product, the {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/hashwallet' verdict='true' %} indiegogo project. There are production and shipping delays with the [HashWallet Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/hashwallet-the-most-secure-hardware-wallet#/updates/all).

The [Hashwallet Link](https://shop.esignus.com/products/hashwallet-link-cobalt) has two versions, Silver and Cobalt. Apart from the significant difference in price, they are [technically similar](https://t.me/hashwallet/14077).

- NFC-enabled
- It is claimed that it is BIP-39 compliant, however, **12-24 seed phrases are not provided.**
- Compatible with Simplex and Changelly
- Requires HashWallet Manager App 
- Secure Element: Infineon SLE78

> Although we are compatible with BIP-39, you won't need to worry about writing down 24 words and keeping them safe. If you lose your HASHWallet Link, no one will have access to your keys, and there is no way to perform any transaction. Your assets are always safe.
>
> Just order a duplicate of your HASHWallet Link through your HASHWallet Manager App, and you will receive a new card with one of the recovery elements of your keys that were stored offline. Once you scan the card, you will download the other recovery element from your backup account (encrypted with zero knowledge technology), and the keys will be regenerated inside the secure element.


## Analysis 

The card **does not have a display or interface** which would allow the user to verify or confirm transactions.
