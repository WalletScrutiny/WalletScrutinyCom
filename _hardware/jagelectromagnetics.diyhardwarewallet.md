The social media account for this specific project has not been updated since 2018 and the website is down. Any quotes listed below were taken from the [archived version of the website.](https://web.archive.org/web/20200131050319/http://www.diyhardwarewallet.com:80/)

From the description:

> Shown below is the original transaction scheme proposed by JAG Electromagnetics in early 2017 for a client that had requested the development of a professional hardware wallet. This scheme was first tested with a raspberry pi zero loaded with firmware to prove that bitcoin transactions could be done by the JAG R&D team. After the proof of concept phase, JAG moved forward to the second and third phases of development and this proof of concept model was abandoned and was slated for destruction.
>
> A JAG R&D team member suggested that instead of destroying the work that had already been done in the proof of concept phase, that we should turn it into a DIY project for hobbyists and makers and give away the firmware and the use of the associated basic web application (terminal) for free. As a consequence, the DIY bitcoin hardware wallet project was born.

Here is the list of required materials:

> - Adafruit 128x64 OLED Bonnet for Raspberry Pi Zero, PRODUCT ID: 3531, Price $22.50 USD, Link https://www.adafruit.com/product/3531
> - Raspberry Pi Zero WH (Zero W with Headers), PRODUCT ID: 3708, Price $14.00 USD, Link https://www.adafruit.com/product/3708
> - 8GB SD Card w/ Stretch Lite, PRODUCT ID: 2820, Price $9.95 USD, Link https://www.adafruit.com/product/2820
> - Adafruit Raspberry Pi Zero Case, PRODUCT ID: 3252, Price $4.75 USD, Link https://www.adafruit.com/product/3252

The repository that purportedly contains the DIY wallet's **firmware also seems to have been deleted or moved**. This is also the case for the "companion website" where the user could manage the wallet. The homepage is still there but the rest of the page does not function properly.

Because of this, we have to assume this project is **defunct.**
