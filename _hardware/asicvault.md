There are [multiple](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5341381.0) [posts](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5186716.0) [on bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2706485.msg43306498#msg43306498) concerning suspicious activity and dishonesty surrounding "Asic Vault" and its history.

As of January 22, 2022, which was more than 3 years after the initial launch, the product was still in pre-order status. 

Eventually the website silently went down. No word on what happened to the product. The website was first announced on [twitter on October 24, 2017](https://twitter.com/AsicVault/status/922741020038660097). A "prototype" was shown on [YouTube on October 23, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_hdvYUQNxo).

## "Features"

Claimed features of the product had included:

> All crypto accelerators operate on constant time to eliminate side channel attacks. Licensed DPA countermeasures are used and all critical crypto operations are performed on internal supercapacitor power only.
>
> It is one thousand times more expensive to crack the private keys stored inside AsicVault.
>
> In just a few seconds the device can perform over 2 million iterations of PBKDF2 SHA-512

It also claims to support:

> - Full pruned node
> - ERC-20 tokens 
> - 2-factor authentication
> - Secure storage
> - Crypto accelerator
> - Password Manager
> - Active and passive intrusion detection
> - Low power integrated circuits
> - Instant self-destruct modes

Its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AsicVault/asicvault-hardware) has not been updated [since 2021.](https://github.com/AsicVault/asicvault-hardware/commits/main/) Since then, there has been no activity on its social media channels.

Until further update, our conclusion is that this product is **vaporware.**
