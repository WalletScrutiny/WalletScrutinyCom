**Caution** There are [some posts](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5186716.0) on bitcointalk.org that make one question this product. 

The product is still in Pre-Order status as of January 22, 2022, more than 3 years after the launch. The website was first announced on [twitter on October 24, 2017](https://twitter.com/AsicVault/status/922741020038660097). A prototype was shown on [YouTube on October 23, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_hdvYUQNxo).

## Features

Claimed features of the product include:

> All crypto accelerators operate on constant time to eliminate side channel attacks. Licensed DPA countermeasures are used and all critical crypto operations are performed on internal supercapacitor power only.
>
> It is one thousand times more expensive to crack the private keys stored inside AsicVault.
>
> In just a few seconds the device can perform over 2 million iterations of PBKDF2 SHA-512

It also claims to support:

> - Full pruned node
> - ERC-20 tokens 
> - 2-factor authentication
> - Secure storage
> - Crypto accelerator
> - Password Manager
> - Active and passive intrusion detection
> - Low power integrated circuits
> - Instant self-destruct modes

Its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AsicVault/asicvault-hardware) was last updated a year ago. Since then, there has been no activity on its social media channels. Until further information or announcements are made available, this product retains its last known status.
