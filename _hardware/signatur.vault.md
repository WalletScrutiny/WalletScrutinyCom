## Product Description 

> The Vault is a wireless (NFC) hardware wallet for generating, storing and managing secure keys for cryptocurrencies. It is a highly-secure, EAL6+ conformant, long term (10+ years) storage device. 

It is a cold-storage device, has no battery, no screen and no buttons. The device can create bitcoin addresses. As an NFC device, there must be a way for users to interact with this device. Because of the long period of time that has elapsed since this device was [introduced in 2014](https://twitter.com/Percival/status/474129522317864960), we were not able to find more information. 

At this stage, we have to determine this device as **vaporware**
