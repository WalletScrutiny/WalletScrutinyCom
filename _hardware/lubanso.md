## Analysis 

1. We cannot find information about the operating system: LBTOS
2. A quick search cannot find the Lubanso Manager Apps source code
- The latest version for this is v1.5.4
3. Lubanso has not made any claims that it has publicly available source
4. The device is plugged in to a desktop PC via USB and then connects to the Lubanso Manager App. 

We are inclined to note the following details: the software is proprietary and the reliance on another device could pose some risks.
