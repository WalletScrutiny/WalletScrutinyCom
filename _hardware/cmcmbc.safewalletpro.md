The company has two domains associated with SafeWallet, cmcm.com and [cmcmbc.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20180309162424/https://www.cmcmbc.com/en-us/). The latter of which, is no longer available. It is Cheetah Mobile Blockchain Research Lab's website.

## Analysis

We were not able to find an online shop where we can buy the SafeWallet Pro. With the primary website and Play Store app for the wallet no longer online, the only traces for the device's existence are in the Youtube instructional material, press releases, as well as the user manuals. 

Since the Google Play app is also no longer available, and **operation of the device can only proceed with the app**, it is possible that either the device only had limited production or only working prototypes were released. Suffice to say, no further mention of the device was made after 2018. 

From the instructional video, we also glean that the device does not have a display wherein users could verify and authorize transactions. Verification of transactions is done by clicking a button on the side of the device while it is paired with the mobile app. 

In conclusion, we determine that the {{ page.title }} is heavily reliant on the mobile phone app and thus prone to threats on the other system.
