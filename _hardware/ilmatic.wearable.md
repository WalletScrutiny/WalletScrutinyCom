The website ilmatic.com [used to feature](https://web.archive.org/web/20180425234027/https://ilmatic.com/) a crypto smart watch "ilmatic PRO" but has since been updated and no longer has information on this product. It now redirects [to a website](https://tamez.vc/) concerning the company's CEO, Danny Tamez.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ilmatic is a peer to peer electronic cash system built for retail payments <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TCTopPicks?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TCTopPicks</a> <a href="https://t.co/GJ1eg1Fstm">pic.twitter.com/GJ1eg1Fstm</a></p>&mdash; TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) <a href="https://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1200837899090046978?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The [providers mentioned](https://web.archive.org/web/20180822065429/http://ilmatic.com/read/faq.html) that they were "planning an ICO that will adhere to SEC regulations within the USA."

[Two](https://www.the-blockchain.com/2018/04/20/ilmatic-announces-wearable-hot-wallet-for-real-world-crypto-payments/) [external](https://crypto.news/spend-your-cryptocurrency-with-ilmatic-wrist-wallet/) sites promoting this device talk about ilmatic's wallet as an **upcoming** product. Both of these sites come from 2018, and there has not been recent information since. Even the Twitter account for the ilmatic company hasn't seen activity since 2019. 

With all of the information listed above, we can conclude that the ilmatic qualifies as **vaporware.**
