## Analysis

### Private keys can be created offline

Yes, and they are displayed on the [actual device.](https://secuxtech.com/community/how-it-works/shield-bio/setup-a-new-wallet?srsltid=AfmBOoodaW2E5KQ9EZ95QMYduTpYw9MRh3oLgUI--mzSLErJtoVmj1PE#download-app) 

### Private keys are not shared and the device displays the receive address for confirmation. 

The device connects via bluetooth to the mobile app and the keys are not shared. This is seen in [this guide.](https://secuxtech.com/community/how-it-works/send-and-receive-shield-bio/send-funds-on-mobile)

### The transaction confirmation commences after tapping "confirm" in the fingerprint pad

Despite the existence of [SecuXtech's organization](https://github.com/secuxtech) page on GitHub, the device's firmware is **not source-available** and is proprietary.
