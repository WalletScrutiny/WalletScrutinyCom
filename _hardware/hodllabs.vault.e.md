## Analysis 

The package comes with the following: 

- Recovery seed card
- Lanyard
- Welcome card
- Vault E
- Micro USB cable
- Box

Based on the video above, the device appears to have a display and a joystick button. It also has a Type-C jack and a micro USB port. The device can connect to a computer or a mobile device. It's form factor is very similar to that of {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/ledgerNanoS' verdict='true' %}. 

Hodllabs' claims that the project is Open Source but we were [not able to find any repository](https://github.com/orgs/hodllabs/repositories) corroborating this. We asked for [more details](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1526404072332398592) on Twitter. Hodllabs' Twitter account started posting sometime in August 2019. The [first blog post](https://hodllabs.io/blog.html) was also made during that time.

But for now, based on the information we've collected, we believe that the {{ page.title }} is **not yet released**.
