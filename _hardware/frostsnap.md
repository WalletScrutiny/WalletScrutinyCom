## Update 2024-10-21

Development is still ongoing with the [latest commit](https://github.com/frostsnap/frostsnap/commit/bf98cfda9b21a005802b36b4467eace5598155ec) made on October 9, 2024. 

We [posted](https://x.com/dannybuntu/status/1848285304152789134) on X.com to ask when they would be releasing their device.

We derived the version number from the project's [cargo.toml](https://github.com/frostsnap/frostsnap/blob/master/device/Cargo.toml) file.

## Product Description 2024-01-05

> Connect one or more Frostsnap devices to your phone and easily create a Bitcoin wallet in our app.
>
> If you create a `2-of-3`, any two devices are required to access your wallet.
>
> You can geographically separate your Frostsnap devices or share them amongst individuals you trust.
>
> With Frostsnap, the strong security you need is now accessible.
