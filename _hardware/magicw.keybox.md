## Analysis 

The provider [claims](https://keybox.magicw.net/indexen.html) that:

> 1.私钥永不触网
> 即使您的PC或手机被黑,
> 您的资产仍然是安全的. 

Translated from Chinese:

*"Even if your PC or phone is hacked, your assets are still safe"*.  

This is a very tall and sweeping statement. The user would simply have to trust this statement as if it were set in stone. But there are many things that are concerning about this. For one, the daemon: [keyboxd,](https://github.com/KeyboxWallet/keyboxd) that bridges the software and hardware aspects of the {{ page.title }} was last updated in 2018. 

Secondly, the device is attached to another device - either a PC or an Android phone. It is not specified how the private keys are protected even from a hacked PC or phone. Without this detail, we assume that the private keys **are shared with another device**.
