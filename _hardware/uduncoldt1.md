We found that this product looks to be very similar to {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/ellipaltitan' verdict='true' %}.
Like Ellipal, it resembles a mobile phone with a screen display and button.

From the website's English alternative [in the hardware wallet's page:](https://www.uduncloud.com/en/products/hardware)

> Integrated and sealed all-metal body, a cold wallet that safely isolates the network.

We found [another page concerning this product](https://www.uduncloud.com/products/hardware-pack) on the orginal website.

> The hardware wallet is physically isolated, and the private key encryption never touches the Internet. Physical isolation, tamper-proof and tamper-proof, does not require any trust.

It also claims that the wallet supports "33 public chains and thousands of tokens."

The site asks you to sign in or create an account before you can access the shop page.

[Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D8OqKqNiiA) showcasing this product. At 0:30, the video shows the user making a transaction on the app and then confirming the transaction on the wallet. This is done by scanning the QR code generated by the hardware wallet.

UDUN has a Github account although none of the repositories held any relevant results for the wallet's firmware. With no information concerning this from the providers, we have to assume that the wallet's source code is **not up for review.**
