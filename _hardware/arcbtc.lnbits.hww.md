## Product Description 

> This product includes the following items:
> 
> - LilyGo TTGO ESP32 microcontroller
> - USB C cable
> - A 3D printed case for the hardware wallet.

It is possible to flash the binaries from a browser [here](https://lnbits.github.io/hardware-wallet/installer/).

> This very cheap off the shelf hardware wallet is designed to work with Lilygos Tdisplay, but you can easily make work with any ESP32.
>
> Data is sent to/from the Hardware Wallet over webdev Serial, not the most secure data transmission method, but fine for handling small-medium sized amounts of funds. You can use LNbits OnchainWallet extension, or any other serial monitor.
>

## Analysis 

Although this kit is packaged as a device, it can still be classified as a **do-it-yourself** hardware wallet since the end user would have to perform some additional steps prior to making it work.
