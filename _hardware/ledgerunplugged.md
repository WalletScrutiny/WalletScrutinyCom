The [provider's website has a clear statement](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010500620-Discontinued-products?docs=true) that this wallet is discontinued and we considered it defunct.

As can be seen in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZhbLtPlU5I), the
device had no screen, so transactions cannot be verified with it, defeating the
point of a hardware wallet.
