Information about this product online is scarce, especially since it has a generic name. [The official website](https://www.bitcoinwalletcards.com/) is empty besides a header:

> PHLsystems <br />
-one step ahead-

[Here is a link to its page on Amazon.](https://www.amazon.com/BITCOIN-Plastik-Giftcard-Offline-Storage/dp/B075KJHZQ4) The Bitcoin Wallet Card is listed as "currently unavailable."

> 
  - The safest way to store a crypto currency
  - Both keys on the card
  - No log, no fees when 3rd party
  
The product description states that the product is recommended for the "Bitcoin Blockchain" as well as Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

> This controller is recommended as well as for Bitcoin Blockchain as well as for the bitcoin cash coins. 

We also found [a Litecoin card wallet](https://www-amazon-de.translate.goog/bitcoinwalletcards-com-LITECOIN-Offline-Storage-CryptoCurrancy/dp/B075DBRHCW?_x_tr_sl=de&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=sc) on sale by the same brand. Both product descriptions advertise card wallets with **pre-generated private and public keys:**

> The safest way to store a cryptocurrency is a wallet (crypto purse) where you have both keys (public and private key). <br />
The public key is used to receive the coins, the private key is used to send them.<br />
Online services where you create a wallet do not provide a private key. If this online service is no longer available,<br />
falls victim to a hacker attack or suffers a hardware error, you will no longer be able to access your coins.<br />
A waterproof PVC plastic card with both keys (as a number/letter combination AND QR code) is the safest method.<br />
The private key is covered with a scratch surface. There are NO coins on the card upon delivery.<br />
The "account balance" of the card can be viewed via the blockchain of the respective currency.<br />
To ensure maximum security, the cards are generated using an offline computer and printed using dye-sublimation technology. <br />
After each finished print, both keys are destroyed by an automated script. This means that each card is unique and cannot be
restored.


Both of these products, as well as the provider's website, are unavailable. There is little sign they will ever make a return. It is safe to assume that they can be sorted as **defunct.**
