## Interface - ✔️

The device has a large enough display to show the public address of the wallet as well as the keys. There are also buttons to help the user navigate the options in the device. 

## Code and Reproducibility

As with the associated mobile app, there are no outward claims that the D'CENT wallet is open source. While they do have [several repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/DcentWallet/repositories) and one pertaining to their '[Biometric Firmware](https://github.com/DcentWallet/biometric-firmware)', these merely include images or bin files that have no build instructions or other information.
