The last twitter post of the Octowallet was made on [March 1, 2019.](https://twitter.com/OctoWallet/status/1079365807707086848). The first working prototype was shown on twitter on [August 3, 2018.](https://twitter.com/OctoWallet/status/1025206431505502208). The Youtube video linked-to on the tweet is now removed. 

Photos of the first order of Octowallet Silo's are in this [tweet](https://twitter.com/OctoWallet/status/1096284595962564608/photo/2).

The subdomain shop.octowallet.com is also no longer accessible as of today.

## Private Keys

Octowallet claims that it has utilizes "asynchronous ring oscillators whitened using LFSRs" to make private key generation more secure.

It also claims that the private keys are stored on the device.

We weren't able to find references on the site claiming that it is an open source project.

## Shop link not working

The inaccessibility of Octowallet's shop link, the inactivity of their social media accounts, the absence of their YouTube videos lend us to temporarily conclude that this product is no longer available in the market.  

We [reached out to Octowallet's twitter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1485533095663398913) to ask them whether their product is still available. Until such time they reply, we would have to conclude that this product was already **discontinued**.
