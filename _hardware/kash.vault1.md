**⚠️ Warning:** Third party websites have listed this project as having held an ICO on April 8, 2018. The homepage is now inaccessible and there were no archived versions in archive.org. Most information about this device is now only available through [Medium.](https://medium.com/kash-hardware-wallet/announcing-the-kash-token-sale-3b4c4251e3e4)

## Product Description 

The Kash Vault 1.0, as it was supposedly called, is a wearable multi-currency hardware wallet. Buying $KASH tokens granted users membership which was the only way to acquire the devices. Apart from renderings, we were not able to locate actual images of an actual device. 

## Verdict 

Information pertaining to the device was general in nature about how hardware wallets worked. With no reviews, websites, shop or videos, **we highly doubt this device ever existed.** The fact that an ICO was held supposedly to fund this project gives the prospect of this device ever reaching the market closer to 'never'.
