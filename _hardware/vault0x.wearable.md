## Product Description

Announced on [January 22, 2018](https://www.facebook.com/vault0x/posts/1637873636291765?__cft__[0]=AZVZBb2l4SHXTf5du2EwROQX4BXihpReJQjvKb2gSsF4ojgsEF6tpDzr-lupLY7QqRNB5TnKgMq3GuTvo7fC6LmtIMmXtjtiY-7x6X-S9VtMZwhIrn5j03XeOK1GJ5YbEB3Tlkh64J9bQm-exfth4iMYHuFwm-cW6G4y0vdwqSE4eQ&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R), the Vault0x website is no longer accessible but can still be accessed via [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20180921024302/http://vault0x.io/). 

At the time of their promotion, they claim that the watch is made of aluminum and **"gold plated USB connection endpoint with a polycarbonate body and silicone straps."**

They also promised a "hybrid" crypto wallet where users "maintain full control over their private keys".

Their promotion also claims that it's the world's "first wearable hardware crypto wallet".

Other claimed features:

- long battery life
- recovery through 24-word mnemonic
- "2FA on the go"
- waterproof

## Verdict 

Since the website is no longer available and no other documentation, process or hardware specifications can be found, it is safe to assume that **this product never came to be**.
