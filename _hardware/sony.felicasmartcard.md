It was [Bitcoin.com's news arm](https://news.bitcoin.com/contactless-smart-card-system-japan-bitcoin-hardware-wallets/) that broke the news that Sony was integrating a Bitcoin wallet in its Felica smart card product. This was during the height of Bitcoin's popularity in 2017. 

> Plans have been announced for each contactless smart card to include a bitcoin wallet that holds a private key on the card.

At its core, it is an NFC card that's used for transportation, e-ID, e-money, CE, IoT, e-tickets and other similar applications.

## Analysis 

Despite the marketing hype, the product was not launched as a cryptocurrency hardware wallet. 

The year is now 2023, and there are other Bitcoin related NFC-card solutions. Sadly, there is no proof that the Sony Felica gained market momentum in this capacity. Since then, we did not find any further news that it was released as a Bitcoin hardware wallet. This is now considered as **vaporware**.
