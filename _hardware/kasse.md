{{ page.title }} has screen and buttons and a secure element with a true
random number generator but there appears to be no public source code, so their
claims are **not verifiable**.

Also the [latest software update](https://kasseusa.com/software/) is from
2020-04-16 which makes the product **stale** by our definition.

The product *only working with Windows* would be yet another down-side.
