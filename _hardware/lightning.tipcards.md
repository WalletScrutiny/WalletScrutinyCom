## Analysis 

This is more of a software product but we classified it nevertheless in hardware, since the idea of a "tip card" elicits the manifestation of a physical card. 

The process goes as follows: 

1. The giver accesses the url: https://tipcards.io/
2. Clicks on "Create your Tip Cards set âš¡"
3. Enters the option for the number of cards
4. Enters the card headline
5. Enters the card text
6. Below is a set of prefilled QR codes which can then be printed 
7. The giver can then choose to fund each card by scanning the QR code
8. The giver can then gift it to someone in however form they wish such as a business card, or as a simple card. 
9. When the receiver scans the QR code, he is brought to the landing page of tipcards, where the user is "orange pilled", given a wallet recommendation and then is credited the Sats. 

This project has its source publicly available and thus users can make their own implementations and redirect to their own urls instead of https://tipcards.io. 

This makes it a **do-it-yourself project.**
