## Update 2024-10-22

Ever since our initial review, no further updates have been made about the Nymi Band's bitcoin-related functions. There is also no mention of "bitcoin" or "crypto" on the website anymore. The company and the product still exists but sans bitcoin. Although, the band still exists, just not in a bitcoin sense, we will mark this product as **defunct** and **vaporware.**

## Previous Review 2022-02-18

Bionym [rebranded into Nymi in 2014](https://archive.canadianbusiness.com/technology-news/whats-in-a-name-bionym-rebrands-itself-as-nymi/). The company's focus was on wearable biometric devices that authenticated users for various purposes. 

This is the [CoinDesk article](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2014/02/04/heartbeat-sensing-wristband-doubles-as-bitcoin-wallet/) that broke the news:

> The wallet is physically stored on the Nymi, says Bionym’s Chief Cryptographer, Yevgeniy Vahlis, and thanks to its multi-factor authentication system, ensures secure bitcoin storage. All the user has to do to make a transaction is tap the wristband, no additional input is necessary.
> 
> It is also possible to back up the key on an offline device, just in case the user happens to lose the wristband.

The Chief Cryptographer for this project was Yevgeniy Vahlis. On his Linkedin profile, he listed Nymi as an employer until June 2015. Whereas D'Souza parted with Nymi on February 2015.

Today, the Nymi band is a part of the Nymi's Connected Worker Platform, an employee tracking program that combines biometrics, with wearable technology and workforce management. There is no more mention of Bitcoin on the website.
