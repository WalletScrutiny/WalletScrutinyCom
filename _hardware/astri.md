## Product Description 

From [ASTRI's website](https://www.astri.org/tdprojects/communication/):

> The group has developed a mobile crypto-currency hardware wallet for storing private keys and signing transactions within the device. Special algorithms are developed to prevent malicious attacks and allow keys recovery if the wallet is lost.

From the website, we were able to find a diagram under Secured IoT Communication about how the device is supposed to work. 

A USB dongle with Master Private Key can sign Bitcoin Transactions is described in this [picture](https://www.astri.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/icdd-communication-iot.png).

Apart from that, we were not able to find any other information. We reached out to them via email as this was the communication method that was readily available. Until such time they provide us with product specifications and more details, this product was not released and no indications are available that it will be.

Apart from that, we were not able to find any other information. We reached out to them via email as this was the communication method that was readily available. Until such time they provide us with product specifications and more details, this product was not released and no indications are available that it will be. This qualifies it as vaporware.
