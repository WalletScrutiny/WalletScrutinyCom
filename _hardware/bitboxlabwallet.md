<div class="alertBox"><div>
The product being advertised on the linked website is a fake product and likely doesn't exist.
</div> </div>

This "product" claims to be "{{ page.title }}" while the website, monacowallet.com, has a different name. Additionally, it's copying the name of a popular hardware wallet, {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/bitBox2' verdict='true' %}

The contents of the website is highly suspicious:

- The video linked at the beginning of the homepage leads to [a Youtube video explaining how bitcoin works.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4) It is doubtful that this video has anything to do with that website.
- Bitbox makes a false claim that it is "used by many customers from various regions of the world," as well as offering odd services, as seen here:

> The reason behind that is BitBoxLab Wallet provides you full of secure futures such as generating new wallet, signing a transaction in an offline device (SmartCard), monitoring your transaction history and many more. In addition, you can also manage your multiple wallets using a simple user-friendly Wallet Web app.

Clicking the link to the "Wallet Web app" does not lead you anywhere.

- [Three "reviews" listed in the website that are obviously fake.](https://monacowallet.com/#reviews) It does not link to any of these reviews that are purportedly from Google, Facebook, or Amazon.

The website also makes the claim that:

> BitBoxLab Wallet is now used worldwide. BitBoxLab Wallet provides you highest level of protection keeping your wallet safe.

It also states it has "150k downloads and 10k positive reviews" although there are no results for this "wallet" online, people do not download hardware wallets, and there are no reviews seen anywhere. 

The site [then offers](https://monacowallet.com/#pricing) three "packages." These packages offer strange things such as 1000 messages, 10 projects, and "Premium support."

There are also no actual images of this "wallet." This "{{ page.title }}" is undoubtedly a **fake** product.
