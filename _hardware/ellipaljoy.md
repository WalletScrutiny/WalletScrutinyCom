This product comes from the same providers as {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/ellipaltitan' verdict='true' %}. It [has a Github repository.](https://github.com/ELLIPAL/ellipal-joy)

However, it is assumedly not a hardware wallet as it is only described as a ["Mnemonic Phrase Generator"](https://www.ellipal.com/pages/ellipal-joy-mnemonic-generator). Here is a video detailing how this mnemonic generator works:

Below is part of the description from [the store page:](https://www.ellipal.com/products/ellipal-joy-mnemonic-generator)

> Embed a true random number generator in the ST chipset that delivers 32-bit random numbers generated by an integrated analog circuit. The chip ensures the generation process is completely random.

It also states that {{ page.title }} is completely offline and follows the BIP39 protocol.

> ELLIPAL Joy runs in a completely isolated network environment, no contact with the network. Offline generation to prevent network attacks and absolute security.
>
> Strictly follows the BIP39 standard mnemonic phrase protocol to generate your mnemonic phrases, compatible with all BIP39 wallets. 

The FAQ in the store's description contains a little more information concerning this product.

> **If I don't have ELLIPAL Joy, can I create/restore an account in ELLIPAL TITAN?**<br />
Yes, You can. ELLIPAL Joy is generated on the same principle as ELLIPAL TITAN. This is further proof of the safety level of ELLIPAL TITAN. If you already have ELLIPAL TITAN, you don't have to buy ELLIPAL Joy. If you are using a software wallet or other hardware wallet, why not increase the security level of your mnemonic phrase and address it with ELLIPAL Joy?
>
> **Can mnemonic phrases be stored in ELLIPAL Joy?**<br />
ELLIPAL Joy has no storage function. You need to protect it and store it in a secure place. ELLIPAL Mnemonic Metal will become your indispensable product for protecting mnemonics will become your indispensable product for protecting mnemonic phrase.

There is no indication Ellipal Joy is capable of functioning as a true hardware wallet. It only generates mnemonic phrases which can be used for actual wallets.
