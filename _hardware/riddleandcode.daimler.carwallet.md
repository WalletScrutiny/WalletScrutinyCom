## Background 

Daimler has partnered with Riddle and Code to create what they described as a car hardware wallet. This was reported on various media pages in July 2019. 

## Product Description 

This was described in an article on [fierceelectronics.com](https://www.fierceelectronics.com/electronics/daimler-partners-to-create-blockchain-hardware-wallet-for-fleet-cars):

> It offers vehicle fleets a cryptographic identity for vehicles to record a vehicle’s performance and to make sure it has up-to-date maintenance.
>
The unit integrates with the vehicle telematic control unit to receive, sign and attest to sensory data from the car and even the surrounding infrastructure. It could be used in relaying traffic patterns and to communicate with smart city signals and other infrastructure. Accident information could be transferred to insurance providers using blockchain-certified data. 

## Analysis 

The [official specification sheet](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58f7bc39bebafb94498d25bf/t/5d3579bedca0840001b5104a/1563785666184/CarWallet_RIDDLE%26CODE_PR_English.pdf) is no longer online.

The technology describes the use of digital ledger technology to collect and quantify data pertaining to the use of the vehicle. There was no mention of using cryptocurrencies including bitcoin. 

This is **not a bitcoin wallet** and is most likely discontinued.
