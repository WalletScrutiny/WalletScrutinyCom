**⚠️ Note:** Qompass held a token sale sometime in 2018. They claim to have [reached their softcap of $2,000,000](https://twitter.com/QompassMarkets/status/999675258218008576). Their [last tweet](https://twitter.com/QompassMarkets/status/995717627921158144) was made on May 14, 2018.

This project has also been flagged at [bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3206704.1040)

## Product Description

The {{ page.title }} is described as a "smart hybrid hardware wallet and payment card". They also claim that it had the capability to withdraw from regular bank ATMs. They also claim that the card can pair with their mobile app via NFC. 

## Analysis 

The project ceased to make any announcements after their ICO in 2018. The whitepaper is no longer available. There are no hardware specification sheets for their "hybrid card". 

We **doubt this product ever existed**.
