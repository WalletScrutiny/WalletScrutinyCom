This wallet has a companion app: {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/io.blns' verdict='true' %} 

The first tweet of the blnswallet was made on [January 15, 2019](https://twitter.com/blnswallet/status/1085203745129066499). Since then, there has been no announcement from the official twitter account regarding their product. It has been treated like a personal account. 

The 'Get blnscard' link still points to an ip address rather than a domain name, with an html page named 'waiting-list'. 

## Product Description

> It provides the convenience of a mobile app paired with near-field communication (NFC) contactless technology, ensures the secure storage of your digital assets, and will be the most affordable hardware wallet in the market.
>
> Along with its companion mobile app, blnscard has been designed for quick and easy transacting, offering multi-coin support. This initially includes BTC, ETH, and LTC, with more coins to be added in due course.
>
> The mobile app also allows users to buy coins for fiat using a credit/debit card. Users can also trade between different coin pairs seamlessly without leaving the wallet.

## Verdict

There are no indications showing that blnscard is actively being developed. Until such time that new information is released, this product will retain its previous status.
