This Bitcoin SV project launched an [indiegogo fundraiser in 2019](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/kaching-secure-bitcoin-wallet/#/). It was later on [acquired by Abendum](https://twitter.com/KaChingCards/status/1295740470967115776).

> By storing your private Bitcoin keys on an offline smart card, it will be almost impossible for a hacker to steal your Bitcoin. At the same time, you will have easy access to your funds by tapping your card to your phone.
>
> When we ship out our first batch of smart cards as perks, the phone app will be able to manage the card as a basic hardware wallet.

The documentation and specifications are available in PDF via [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20201112020822/https://kaching.cards/katp.pdf).

On June 1, 2021 Bitcoin.no AS made this [announcement](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/kaching-secure-bitcoin-wallet/#/updates/all): 

> KaChing.cards – legal company Bitcoin.no AS – was acquired by the Norwegian company Abendum AS in June 2020 with the goal to restart the project.
>
> For different reasons this proved more challenging than anticipated and the available resources in Abendum required to be focused on the development of the core product “Abendum - Triple Entry Accounting and Auditing”.
>
> We have therefore after 12 months decided to offer a refund to the backers of the “KaChing: Secure Bitcoin Wallet” crowdfunding and thereafter decommission the company Bitcoin.no AS.
>
> If you choose to get your Indiegogo donation refunded, we hereby offer to pay back your donation in BitcoinSV (BSV).

It's an NFC Smart Card that **does not support BTC** and with the latest information about Bitcoin.No AS' acquisition and refund, is **vaporware**
