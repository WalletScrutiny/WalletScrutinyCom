The primary 'website' of this project is a discord channel. There hasn't been much activity in it later than June 2021. The last official announcement was on June 4, 2021:

> some news
> - project is still alive
> - we got some new contributors, in private for now
> - we work at refactor our code arch so to make it easier to release and use (more straightforward instructions, easier to upgrade from stock micropython)
>
> as for the 3d printed enclosure
> the round version proves to be quite problematic if the cap goes out: the board switches are very fragile and often end up broken in the process
> we advise to rather use the straight version for the moment

## Verdict

All indications point to an unreleased project with no publicly available proof of a working prototype. The GitHub repository does not have instructions on how to build but merely indicated a note that instructions are forthcoming. This was last updated also on June 2021.
