## Private keys can be created offline?

[**Yes**](https://blog.keyst.one/why-air-gap-hardware-wallets-offer-superior-security-over-usb-connected-hardware-wallets-8343fa76f7d4)

## Private keys are not shared? 

[**Yes**](https://blog.keyst.one/blind-signing-a-security-black-hole-for-the-ethereum-community-13f909b848b6)

Although the provider claims that the hardware wallet does not have its own wallet software [(Source)](https://keyst.one/btc-only), it claims to have anti-leak technology that prevents blind signatures.

It communicates to the bound app using QR codes. You can see this process in this [demonstration video](https://youtu.be/772O-NYmd1s?si=arDzCzjwAJYdXyyz&t=569) by a third-party.

## Device displays receive address for confirmation

**Yes**. This is displayed on the screen. When sending BTC from the linked wallet, users can select either **"Export Transaction"** or **"Import Signature"**. Then the sub-choices for Export Transaction are: **Export via QR**, or **Export via File**.

The hardware device then generates a QR code for the authorization. 

## Interface

**Yes**. There is a screen and the confirmation mechanism is via the touchscreen using a sliding bar and a pin code. The authorization is performed by using the wallet app to scan the QR code generated by the device.

## Reproducibility

This hardware wallet is [**for verification.**](https://gitlab.com/walletscrutiny/walletScrutinyCom/-/issues/524)

We were able to craft a script from their provided [build instructions](https://github.com/KeystoneHQ/keystone3-firmware/blob/master/docs/verify.md). 

## Results

```
All builds complete.

Unsigned Binary from Keystone Website :
Firmware checksum sha256: 427e41a1b0bb25d122e06884464f1cebd7b526b35c975a39151a8e6ffc2fc352 
You can check this value on your device.
------------------------
Unsigned .bin hash must be the same as mh1903.bin.
```

Following instructions from their documentation seems to indicate that the built file `mh1903.bin` has the same checksum as the downloaded binary. 

However, we decided to take a closer look at the process behind the firmware checker. 

We created an [issue](https://github.com/KeystoneHQ/keystone3-firmware/issues/967) in the repository of the provider.

They [promptly replied](https://github.com/KeystoneHQ/keystone3-firmware/issues/967#issuecomment-2085060319), and pointed out that:
> The keystone3-unsigned.bin is actually the compressed version of mh1903.bin with some headers, so what firmware-checker does is decompress the content then do a sha256 checksum.
