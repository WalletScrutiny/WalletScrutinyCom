## How it works 

Cryptnox gave this brief on [how the device works](https://htecgroup.com/client-stories/cryptnox-building-state-of-the-art-private-key-safety/): 

> Our Client Cryptnox wanted to make this entire process even safer by allowing the user to use a hardware wallet without having to work with the mnemonic phrase. They came up with an idea to offer users two separate cards, hardware wallets, which can generate the same private key inside of them without ever exposing it to the outside world.
>
This would allow users to use one card when they are making transactions and if that card gets stolen, or lost, they will have the backup, the other card which they have previously placed in a safe or some other secure place. As the cards are identical, the user can transfer the assets to another account from the backup card. Cryptnox needed somebody to help them implement their ideas in an innovative way — they approached HTEC Group to help them develop applications with a user-friendly interface that could perform a variety of advanced functionalities and turn their idea into a reality. 
>
Solution
We developed a complete iOS companion application that allows users to do transactions on Blockchain networks. The solution supports Bitcoin and Ethereum, and the user can, in CLI, use more granular commands, including working with smart contracts and the EOS network. At its core, it is a modern crypto wallet that uses our client’s cards for transaction signing. 

## Analysis 

The device noticeably has no display or means for the user to interact directly with the card. As mentioned above, the device needs the companion app:

> "We developed a complete iOS companion application that allows users to do transactions on Blockchain networks"  

Without a display, the user would not be able to approve transactions physically using the card. Transactions may be **signed blindly.**
