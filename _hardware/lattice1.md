Lattice devices can work in conjunction with the providers safecards, safecards store private keys offline from the lattice device.
Safecards themselves could be considered wallets, but they are unable to sign transactions without the lattice device.

The lattice device should be reviewed in conjuction with the safecard, the safecard by itself is of no use without the lattice device.

Until further investigation we list this device as **closed source** though, as
the provided GitHub account doesn't contain a firmware repository. Only
[lattice-firmware-history](https://github.com/GridPlus/lattice-firmware-history)
which is a README.md file listing changes to the firmware but no actual firmware
code.
