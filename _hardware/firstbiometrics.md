## Update 2024-10-18

After three years of little to no activity, this product still seems to be a prototype. Investors could get in touch with Firstbiometrics via email, and learn more about the product. We do not think this is a consumer product that can be readily bought. With only generic wallet information about the product and no technical specifications, and with no recent updates from this product, we are marking this product as **vaporware**

## Product Description 2022-03-11

In the product page, {{ page.title }} claims to be a "Hardware Wallet with Biometric ID Card"

> The First Biometrics Crypto Hardware Wallet is your all-in-one solution designed to be the vault for all your digital assets. Store and encrypt the top 30+ coins and keep all your passwords and digital keys in a secure location.

There's no indication of a shop or online store to buy this product. It looks as though the wallet is currently unreleased, although there was an image of the card in the homepage and the ["prototypes"](https://firstbiometrics.com/prototypes) section.


## Analysis 

There is currently no link to the shop for any products, parts of the website [look to be incomplete](https://firstbiometrics.com/news/), and the social media linked by the website have little to no recent activity. Until further information, we have to assume this product is **yet to be released.**
