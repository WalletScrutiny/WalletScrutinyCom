## Product Description 

In the product page, {{ page.title }} claims to be a "Hardware Wallet with Biometric ID Card"

> The First Biometrics Crypto Hardware Wallet is your all-in-one solution designed to be the vault for all your digital assets. Store and encrypt the top 30+ coins and keep all your passwords and digital keys in a secure location.

There's no indication of a shop or online store to buy this product. It looks as though the wallet is currently unreleased, although there was an image of the card in the homepage and the ["prototypes"](https://firstbiometrics.com/prototypes) section.


## Analysis 

There is currently no link to the shop for any products, parts of the website [look to be incomplete](https://firstbiometrics.com/news/), and the social media linked by the website have little to no recent activity. Until further information, we have to assume this product is **yet to be released.**
