[Here is a demonstration](https://twitter.com/arcbtc/status/1484942260013838336) of arcbtc's Bitcoin PoS. It is also known as LNPoS.

The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/arcbtc/LNPoS) has some more information about the product.

> Lightning-network uses hot wallets and real-world payments are made from phones. The burden of connectivity can be taken away from the point-of-sale and given to the phone.
>
> LNURLPoS uses the LNURL-pay protocol. LNURL-pay allows your lightning-wallet to make a secure request to a server to get a lightning-network invoice. So instead of scanning a massive ugly lightning-network invoice QR, you can scan a lovely little LNURL QR (if you decode an LNURL you'll see its just a URL).

The Twitter clip showcases versions of LNPoS with varying prices, including a barebones DIY version. However, there is yet to be a website with an official shop for these products.

{{ page.title }} is **not primarily a hardware wallet** and is always instead described as a lightning network point-of-sale.
