## Product Description 

From [the online store:](https://www.stakebox.org/collections/real-crypto/products/bitcoin-holographic-coin)

> We bring to you our very first limited edition Bitcoin collector coin. This is a holographic cold storage wallet, allowing you to secure your digital Bitcoin and hold it in physical form.

and:

> Our holographic coins are cold storage wallets. This means you can store your private keys behind the hologram and it showcases your public key so you can receive crypto on your new cold storage wallet. We include detailed instructions that make it easy to put these together, as well as videos on our media page showing a visual step-by-step process of how to create your secure wallet and apply it to the coin.

## Analysis 

From the [website's disclaimer:](https://realcrypto.org/hologram-how-tos/bitcoin-how-to/)

> If someone gets a hold of your coin and takes off the hologram, they own your private keys to this wallet. Real Crypto has no liability for your lost, stolen or hacked private keys. These instructions are here to help you stay safe but we make no guarantee that this will prevent hackers from obtaining your private keys. By making a cold storage wallet on a computer and printer that has or will ever be connected to the internet, you must accept a level of risk that your private keys could be compromised. 


The webpage has instructions on how to generate QR codes for public and private keys. This involves downloading walletgenerator.net's Github Repository and generating keys offline. 

The site suggests that users encrypt the private keys:

> You have the option of encrypting your private key with BIP38 encryption protocol but you will need to keep that encryption key somewhere off the coin. This is an option if you want further protection from theft or loss of your private keys.

It's unclear how this coin is more secure than a regular paper wallet. The keys may not be prefilled as you're meant to print them yourself but somebody could still steal the coin and easily remove the sticker, thus gaining access to your keys.

{{ page.title }} is also listed as out-of-stock on the online stores selling this product. We're assuming that it is now **discontinued or defunct.**
