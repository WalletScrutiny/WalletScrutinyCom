## Overview 

The misleading marketing notwithstanding, we'll take a look at their product. 

The only description we could find was that it: 

> Supports QCXP, BTC and the rest of ERC20 tokens. The most secure way to store your crypto currency. 

From the image we got, the card bears the logo of tangem, indicating they may have pretended to or may have had an alleged partnership with Tangem, the producer of:

With that said, it is clear that **if the card ever existed** under the QuickX branding, it notably does not have an input and output interface. 

## Verdict 

Going over twitter and searching with the terms "quickx" + "hardware", we find some references to youtube videos - most of which have already been taken down. Tangem is a relatively reputable company, but QuickX, no. With no evidence the card ever existed, we classify this as vaporware.
