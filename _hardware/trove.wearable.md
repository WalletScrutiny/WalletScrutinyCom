## Product Description

> TROVE is a wearable device providing a way to store and manage digital currency for daily spending and trading. The system stores cryptocurrency offline on the hardware – rather than online – meaning it is less susceptible to hackers.
>
> Users unlock the system using their ECG signature – a biometric method of verification that recognises a user’s unique heartbeat pattern – by touching the contact zone on the front.
>
> This activates the bluetooth, which communicates with the user’s smartphone and allows funds to be accessed.


Trove is a wearable offline device that utilizes biometric verification. This is meant to recognize the user's "unique heartbeat pattern." The device can be worn as a watch, necklace, or brooch.

This opens a few issues if the user of one of the devices passes away. As he will probably not have a heartbeat pattern anymore, the funds will become completely inaccessible. It's possible there is a feature for family and friends to add their "ECG signatures", but nowhere on the website is a feature like this mentioned.


## Verdict 

This product was released years back in 2018. There is a general lack of documentation concerning its security features and how it functions. Notably, we also could not find any shop for this product online.

As mentioned above, it's stated that Trove depends on the user's smartphone to make transactions. The device may be able to approve transactions, but it has no screen meaning that **it can't confirm the address where the user sends bitcoin.**
