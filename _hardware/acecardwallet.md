## Product Description

The Ace Card Wallet by Digital Systems a.s., is comprised of an SHDC SD card which they claim has a built-in processor and a secure element. The provider claims that embedded inside is a multicurrency wallet. It can be inserted in a smart phone. They also claim that only the Ace App can communicate with the card's secure element. The [data sheet](https://www.digitalsystems.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/AceCardWallet.pdf) claims that the product is in pre-sale. However, the posted data on the PDF file's directory on their site was November 2018. There is a high likelihood that this is **vaporware**.
