## Product Description

> Turn any GameBoy into a secure offline cold wallet. Generate a seed phrase using a hash of your button presses as you walk around and complete quests.
>
> Game Wallet is a GameBoy cartridge that lets players generate mnemonic phrases  for crypto wallets using an offline device.
>
> We converted an open source assembly implementation of the sha256 hashing algorithm used to generate cryptographic seed phrases based on BIP-39 into GBAssembly, the language all GameBoy games are programmed in. Randomness is introduced by the player as they walk around the world and complete engaging quests.
