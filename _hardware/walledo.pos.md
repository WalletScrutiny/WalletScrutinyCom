### Point of Sale setup

This is the Walledo [account setup video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPn2uH3ukZE).

Here we can see that the device connects via WiFi or 3G. The device is then bound to a Walledo account.

## Analysis 

Walledo's point of sale system cannot **be classified as a hardware wallet**. It is primarily used by merchants to accept payments allowing them to receive cryptocurrencies which are then converted to Euros. The device is not marketed for keeping coins secure.
