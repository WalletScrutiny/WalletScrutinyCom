## Background Information

The EOS.CYBEX twitter account posted a [picture](https://twitter.com/EOSCYBEX/status/994195003302801409/photo/1) of the {{ page.title }} on twitter in May 19, 2018. We believe that the image was photoshopped due to the lack of shadows on the finger. 

On its [Medium post](https://medium.com/@eoscybex/an-introduction-to-eos-cybex-3f5d8f7e78c5), the project is described as:

> EOS.CYBEX is dedicated to EOS project incubation and community development. 

One of its projects was a decentralized exchange called cybex.io which was supposed to run on "Graphene technology". The domain is no longer online although its [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cybexmobile.google) is still on Google Play, it was last updated in April 28, 2019.

## Product Description 

From the image we can glean that the card supported NFC, Bluetooth and Biometric scanning. It appears to also have had a companion app. We have suspicions that the image may have been photoshopped. Furthermore, [another picture](https://twitter.com/CybexExchange/status/994496017574719489/photo/2) from an affiliated twitter account shows that the card had a display. 

## Analysis 

We could not find technical specifications for this device (if it ever existed). Cybex and its services did not last for a long time. If it did exist, we most likely believe that it only supported EOS and not BTC. Since the domain for this product is no longer online, it is likely more accurate that the device **never came into production**.
