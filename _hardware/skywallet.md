As of November 29, 2021, the Skywallet is [out of stock](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1465229709285859328). 

It appears that the SkyWallet only supports [Skycoin until a firmware update](https://medium.com/@Skycoinproject/were-very-excited-to-announce-the-immediate-availability-of-the-skywallet-the-sleek-and-4b2cc4d8ddfe) is made for the device. 

Until that firmware update is made, this wallet **does not support Bitcoin**.
