## Analysis 

It would appear that this device is a prototype. We could not find any documentation or description beyond the general information on the archived copy of the site. 

Some information could be gleaned from the video, such as a printed QR code containing the BTC address for the wallet. 

Nevertheless, we [tweeted Chris D'Costa](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1634114747036491776) in the hopes of finding more information about it. 

From the later archived copies of the site, we weren't able to find a shop or a price - indicating that this product may not have reached production. We'll mark it as **vaporware** until further information is available.
