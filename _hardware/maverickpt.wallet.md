The Twitter account for this device (if it ever existed) ceased posting in April 24, 2019. Prior to that, it seems to be an automated account that tweets random things. Its Facebook and Linkedin accounts are no longer available. The image of the device is a stock photo from [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/zagreb-croatia-circa-october-2015-close-345116411).

Nevertheless, here's the description from the listed website: 

> Using our experience in developing and deploying the Portuguese National ID card and its PKI infrastructure, we are developing a hardware wallet using the Portuguese National ID card as the way to safely generate, store and manage public and private cryptoasset keys. The wallet will be compatible with other ECC compliant cards (European Citizen Card) and EMV CAP Javacard

We **do not believe this device ever came to be or will ever be**.
