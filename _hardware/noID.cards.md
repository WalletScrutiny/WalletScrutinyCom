We have reviewed this product's companion app: {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.noid.cards' verdict='true' %}

## Product Description

This is a contactless payment card meant to work with the Lightning network. In the FAQs (found in the homepage) noID.cards states its main goal: to make [Bolt Cards](https://www.boltcard.org/) easy to use. It relies on the companion app to process payment requests rather than a dedicated server.

## Analysis

Although this app allows for fast contactless payments, it still depends on a companion app and has no buttons or screen for verifying and confirming transactions by itself.
