## verdict

The promised date of **"late 2016/early 2017"** is now almost 5 years. We [reached out to Jaxx](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1485819187222450178) via twitter to ask them whether the project is still ongoing. They [replied](https://twitter.com/jaxx_io/status/1489269784898420740): 

> Hi there. We spent the last few years focused on infrastructure. Stay tuned for some exciting announcements in 2022.

Without a concrete release date and information about this project, this project is determined as **vaporware**.
