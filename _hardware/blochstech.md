This hardware device lacks a screen or a button, this device cannot provide
basic security of hardware wallets but even worse, it comes with predefined keys.
According to their [info](http://blochstech.com/info):

> **How do I charge my card?**<br>
  [ ... ] transfer Bitcoin to your card's address. The address is in the letter
  you received with the card.

Their GitHub code was not touched since 2016 and 2019 the provider shared via an
[issue](https://github.com/BlochsTech/BitcoinCardTerminal/issues/14) that the
project was **dead**.
