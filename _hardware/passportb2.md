> 
> Security: Envoy primarily communicates with Passport via airgapped QR codes, ensuring that Passport is never directly connected to an online device.
>
> Privacy: Envoy connects to Foundationâ€™s server and Bitcoin node through Tor. Envoy offers the ability to connect to your own Bitcoin node, cutting out Foundation as the middleman.
