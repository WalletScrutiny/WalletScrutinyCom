## Reproducibility

With the provider's help we updated the [test script](https://gitlab.com/walletscrutiny/walletScrutinyCom/-/blob/master/scripts/test/hardware/passport.sh).

This device runs the "color" version of the firmware so we provide these
parameters to it:
  
* version: 2.3.2
* model: color
* build fingerprint: 88e8af6f50a78a6bce1fb892f61ebd28ac3eca3dec61ec5b5010734db9d7da88
* release fingerprint: efa8c807a4b8d3b089c41cbfa22335a4fe349b7ccd9f0df702903a5a644b351e

The fingerprints can be found on the [release page](https://github.com/Foundation-Devices/passport2/releases).

1. The built binary's sha256 hash matches the expected build hash. -> 88e8af6f50a78a6bce1fb892f61ebd28ac3eca3dec61ec5b5010734db9d7da88
2. The sha256 hash of the release binary, matches the expected hash. -> efa8c807a4b8d3b089c41cbfa22335a4fe349b7ccd9f0df702903a5a644b351e
3. Both the stripped release binary and the built binary have matching hashes. -> 88e8af6f50a78a6bce1fb892f61ebd28ac3eca3dec61ec5b5010734db9d7da88

The verification process successfully proves that the firmware for v2.3.2 is **reproducible**. 

Upon updating your device, you should be shown
`efa8c807a4b8d3b089c41cbfa22335a4fe349b7ccd9f0df702903a5a644b351e` to be sure you got the file that we tested.
