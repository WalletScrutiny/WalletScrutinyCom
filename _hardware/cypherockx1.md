**Disclaimer:** Vipul is the main author of this Analysis and also a contributor

Cypherock was announced in a Bitcointalk ANN thread on February 14, 2020.

Cypherock X1 uses Shamir Secret Sharing to split the private key into 5 shards. Each of the 5 shards are independently stored on the hardware components, namely the X1 Wallet and 4 NFC enabled X1 cards. By implementing a 2/5 cryptographic threshold, a user only requires the X1 Wallet and 1 X1 card to re-create the private key and conduct transactions. Additionally, users don’t need to maintain any form of seed phrase backup as the hardware components themselves act as recovery tools. Cypherock’s private key management architecture not only eliminates the single point of failure of storing private keys in a singular location, but also solves for risks associated with seed phrase backups.
 
## Key features
- The code for the X1 Wallet is [open source](https://github.com/Cypherock/x1_wallet_firmware)
- Users can create a new wallet on the device or import their existing BIP39 compatible wallet to Cypherock X1 without connecting to the internet
- The X1 Wallet is the interfacing device on which the seed regeneration and transaction operations are performed. X1 Wallet also stores 1 of the 5 Shamir shares.
- Each of the 4 remaining Shamir shares is stored in a EAL5+ tamper resistant secure element chips. These are the same smart cards that are used in commercial debit and credit cards.
- Private keys can be recovered by tapping any 1 out of the 4 X1 cards on the X1 Wallet. Shamir secret share stored in the X1 cards and X1 Wallet can optionally be protected using a PIN. The recovered keys are stored in a volatile memory on the X1 Wallet which gets wiped out as soon as the operation is done.
- As Cypherock X1 Wallet does not store the private key as a whole, it is impossible to steal crypto assets in rest state.
- X1 Wallet supports upto 4 wallet recovery phrases, which can be used for transactions or even as a backup.
- X1 Wallet user can view the portfolio of all the 4 wallets from a single screen on their PC on the companion Cypherock CySync desktop application.
- X1 Wallet provides increased security against $5 wrench attack by distributing card into different geographical locations.
- X1 Wallet provides a 5 way navigation switch to perform user actions such as screen navigation and text input.

From the [FAQ](https://www.cypherock.com/faq/): Can the company somehow steal the digital assets of the user?
- It is not possible for the company to steal the digital assets of the users. Cypherock X1 Wallet can recreate the private keys without internet access. The device needs to be connected to the internet just for broadcasting the transaction on the blockchain.
- The provider further claims to use entropy from the ATECC608A "secure element" (which is not open to public audit) as well as from the microprocessor which runs the open source code. Thus, it should be able to prevent poor entropy backdoors in the closed source of the ATECC608A.

## Public repository containing source code

- Cypherock X1 Wallet firmware is open sourced, hosted in GitHub repo: [Cypherock/x1_wallet_firmware](https://github.com/Cypherock/x1_wallet_firmware)
- Latest release source code: [Release v0.4.1290](https://github.com/Cypherock/x1_wallet_firmware/releases/tag/v0.4.1290)
- Cypherock X1 Wallet firmware is released in 2 flavors, “***initial firmware***” and “***main firmware***”.
  - ***Initial firmware*** is installed on the device during manufacturing. It provides minimum functionality such as X1 Wallet and X1 Card authentication which checks if the product is genuine or not. This firmware does not support any wallet related functionality. The initial firmware ceases to exist before any wallet activity is initiated.
  - ***Main firmware*** full fledged wallet related functionality and is installed on the device via the companion Cypherock CySync desktop application.

## Reproducibility of the release binary from the source code
- Cypherock X1 Wallet firmware binary is signed by two private keys. The signature and a signed header is appended on top of firmware binary to form the complete Cypherock X1 Wallet firmware image. 
- An important thing to note here is that the Cypherock X1 Wallet firmware release binary is compiled using Docker. 
- Fingerprint (SHA256 digest) of the latest Cypherock X1 Wallet firmware binary (unsigned) can be found on the release page: [Release v0.4.1290](https://github.com/Cypherock/x1_wallet_firmware/releases/tag/v0.4.1290)
- The docker file corresponding to the latest release can be found here: [Dockerfile v0.4.1290](https://github.com/Cypherock/x1_wallet_firmware/blob/v0.4.1290/Dockerfile)
- List of tools required to successfully build the project can be found here: [Building project](https://github.com/Cypherock/x1_wallet_firmware/tree/v0.4.1290#building-project)
- Sequence of commands run on docker can be found here: [Docker commands v0.4.1290](https://github.com/Cypherock/x1_wallet_firmware/blob/v0.4.1290/.github/workflows/containerized-build.yml)

# Update 2024-12-10 (Version 0.6.1282)
## Please see previous reproducible attempts in the archives below

There has been some notable changes to the way Cypherock X1 firmware is verified and built from v0.6.768. 
The new instructions could be found [here.](https://github.com/Cypherock/x1_wallet_firmware/blob/main/VERIFY.md)

We have created a new script to automate this procedure, but you can still find the old script in the archives.

Here are the results:

```

Note that Cypherock-Initial is no longer found in the releases.

The checksums of the built binary and the release binary match, and thus version 0.6.1282 is **reproducible**.
The checksum for **0.6.1282** can be verified in their repository [here.](https://github.com/Cypherock/x1_wallet_firmware/releases/tag/v0.6.1282)
