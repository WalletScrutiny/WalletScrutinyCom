## Overview

DeviantCoin is a Proof of Stake/Masternode cryptocurrency developed with X11 algorithm. They describe their [hardware wallet](https://deviantcoin.io/hardware-wallet/) as follows: 

> Our hardware wallet will seamlessly sync with the customer account, making sure that tokens are unlocked only after authentication. Although this step has the limitation of orders getting processed only if the hardware wallet is plugged in and online, all tokens that support smart contracts will not have this problem.

They [claim that it will support multiple cryptocurrencies](https://deviantcoin.io/wallets/): 

> We at Deviant coin are planning on releasing a specialized hardware wallet which will not only be durable but also secure. A wallet in which you will be able to securely send, receive and store digital currency. We plan on making it open source as hardware wallets are quintessential for secure transactions and should be available to anyone and everyone. We will be getting our own hardware which will support DEV and other cryptocurrencies. 

According to an [article](https://coinidol.com/privacy-based-cryptocurrency-deviant-coin-announces-whitepaper-release/) written in 2018 from a third-party, the hardware wallet should have been released on the third quarter of 2018.

## Verdict 

There is no indication that this hardware wallet was released. The twitter posts of the account related to deviantcoin last posted on December 15, 2021. This is **vaporware.**
