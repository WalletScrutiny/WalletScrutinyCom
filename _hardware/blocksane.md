## Description 

Information about Blocksane has been very sparse. Most of the information could be found in this [post](https://investforesight.com/digital-signature-to-be-stored-in-a-biometric-hardware-wallet/): 

> A hardware wallet is a small box with a screen. Its dimensions are 11 cm by 7.3 cm by 1.2 cm. It has an in-built banking CC EAL chip and some additional 32 GB memory. The chip can store private keys and digital signatures. Engineering Technologies has applied for a patent to the way of storing private keys and digital signatures in a chip. The hardware wallet will be priced at $150 and manufactured in China (the name of the manufacturer is not disclosed), yet the chip for the wallet will be supplied by a non-Chinese company.
