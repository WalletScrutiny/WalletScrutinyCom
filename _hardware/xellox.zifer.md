## Update 2024-10-23

The store page to the product known as the {{ page.title }} currently leads to a 404 page. The website is still available but with two different named products "Clavis" and "Yokis". Clavis looks similar to the Zifer, but is still in pre-order status. On their FAQ page:

> CLAVIS is intended to be released in Q3 of 2025. We’ll keep everyone who pre-orders closely updated on the progress!

> CLAVIS is much more than a hardware wallet! It’s a new hardware category that combines all our offline accessories into one sleek package. Purely as a hardware wallet, it differentiates by being meant for mass adoption, i.e. enabling real world use. Payments and verifications can be performed in an intuitive and easy manner!

We are seeking to clarify whether the Clavis is a version of Zifer or a completely new product via [x.com.](https://x.com/dannybuntu/status/1848980249079648718)

We will retain the verdict of **unreleased**.
