The company ITBiometrics™ was founded on March 3, 2018 in Los Angeles, California. Announcements of their ITBX Fingerprint bitcoin wallet was first made on October 11, 2018 via [Businesswire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181011005838/en/ITBiometrics%E2%84%A2-Brings-the-Latest-Innovation-in-Crypto-Wallet-Security-to-Money2020), a Berkshire Hathaway company. 

From the description of the device:

> While other cold storage wallets are accessible via security codes, PINs, or passphrases, our product is the first to introduce biometric security.

ITBiometrics™ seem to be focused on leveraging its biometric technology to create products such as the [ITBc Fingerprint Card](https://itbiometrics.com/itbc-fingerprint-card/) and the BCD [Biometric Credentialing Device](https://itbiometrics.com/itbc-fingerprint-card/). 

We were not able to find a retailer or a portal where the device can be purchased so we have to assume that this device is yet to be released commercially. We could not find an online shop nor were there any physical unboxing reviews of the device. Although it claims that one of its features is "Open Source Storage", we were not able to locate any link to any publicly available source code. 

We did find a [tutorial video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=295750178346996) of sorts on Facebook that seem to show how to setup the device. It appears to pair with another app via Bluetooth, although when we searched the website and Google Play, we weren't able to find any app pointing to ITBiometrics™ as the publisher or developer. 

We were also not able to find any information pertaining to how private keys are used or authenticated in the device or whether mnemonic phrases are made available for use with the device. 

It is also worth noting that the company's website and social media accounts seem to be more intent on raising investment for the further development of the product rather than marketing a working product.
