This is the second generation version of the:

- {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/ukiss.hugware' verdict='true' %}

## Product Description from the [{{ page.title }} homepage](https://www.ukiss.io/h2bundle/)

> Upgraded with the H2 chip, Hugware H2 supports networks that apply the ED25519 cryptographic algorithm (i.e., Solana and Cardano). Manage ED25519 blockchain cryptocurrencies on UKISS Hub V1.2 (launching Feb), and, soon, NFTs.
> 
> UKISS Technology issues a certificate of authenticity for each Hugware® key as digital proof that the device is genuine.
>
> Each certificate is verifiable on the Ethereum blockchain through a trusted system built by Singapore-based developer Jupyton. The system complies with GovTech Singapore’s OpenAttestation Framework, ensuring that every UKISSCert is:
> - Tamper-proof
> - Immutable 
> - Verifiable 

## Analysis 

Similar to the {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/ukiss.hugware' %}, the process for interacting with the {{ page.title }} involves plugging one of the devices unto a Windows or MacOS laptop with the [UKiss Hub software installed](https://www.ukiss.io/downloads/). 

## Verdict 

Like its predecessor, the {{ page.title }} **does not have a display or buttons to interact with.** It relies heavily on the UKiss Hub software. It is marketed as a hardware wallet that does not make use of seed phrases. It is primarily oriented towards NFT collectors.
