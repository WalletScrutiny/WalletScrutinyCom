## Product Description 

This version of the the {{ page.title }} connects to the OpenNode *custodial* service. 

[OpenNode's Service described](https://www.opennode.com/): 

> Get lightning-fast, low-cost bitcoin payments and payouts for your business with our powerful API, ecommerce plugins, or hosted payment pages.
>
> Seamlessly convert between Bitcoin and major currencies
automatically at the time of the transaction with locked
exchange rates, or on demand.
> 
> Convert settled funds to/from bitcoin anytime. Hold funds in your preferred currency and optimize funds transfers.
> 
> When you deposit local currency, OpenNode converts to bitcoin at the time payouts are initiated to provide price certainty.

The OpenNode version is a [custodial service](https://youtu.be/o4jqUbmypRQ?t=319).

## Analysis 

The {{ page.title }} is a **do-it-yourself** Point of Sale system that interfaces with a custodial service. It is therefore **not a wallet**.
