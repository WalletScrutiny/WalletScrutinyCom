## Update 2022-11-24

Though not sold by the vendor anymore, the vendor has indicated updating the device's firmware through the app, for legacy users. 

> Since November 2019 we stopped selling the BitBox01. We will continue to support the BitBox01 in our app and through support@shiftcrypto.ch for the foreseeable future.

## Previous Update 2021-08-17

This product has been superseded by the {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/bitBox2' verdict='true' %} device as [stated by the provider](https://shiftcrypto.support/help/en-us/16-bitbox01/143-bitbox01-end-of-sale-life-faqs) it is end of life. Bitbox1 owners can get a discount on the later bitbox2. Bitbox1 is considered discontinued. 

For lack of a screen, this product would otherwise fall into our category {% include verdictBadge.html verdict="noita" type='medium' %}.
