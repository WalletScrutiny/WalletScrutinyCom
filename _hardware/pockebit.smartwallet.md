## Product Background

> Pockebit Smart Wallet is a hardware-based cryptocurrency wallet. Backed up by a strong software package, Pockebit secures all cryptocurrency and standard currency transactions. The Pockebit Smart Wallet app makes cryptocurrencies user-friendly.

On December 16, 2018, Norbert Gehrke published [an article on Medium](https://medium.com/tokyo-fintech/pockebit-smart-wallet-467e0f0a9811) containing basic information on {{ page.title }}. This wallet would have had "built-in virtual credit and debit card functions" as well as a "user-friendly" smartphone app. 
Purportedly, the early prototype of the device was credit-card sized, featuring a screen and a wireless data connection.

> Pre-orders are expected to launch in January 2019, with the first production batch of 5,000 due to be delivered in May 2019.

[Around the same time, Blockcast had also released an article mentioning the product.](https://blockcast.cc/press-releases/pockebit-japanese-startup-presented-a-prototype-of-a-contactless-hardware-wallet/)

Unfortunately, we could not find any information on the product afterwards. The website went offline in 2021 and as of today the domain name is currently available for purchase.

We found the [Pockebit's](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pockebit-cryptowallet/) LinkedIn page; however the account appears to be inactive and completely empty. Interestingly, the website linked in its description is "https://hitowallet.com/."

As it does not appear that this product was ever made available for purchase, we marked it as **vaporware.**
