## Verdict

The Jolt hardware wallet did not reach market production. We [reached out to them](https://mobile.twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1485806434856374273) via twitter to ask how the project is doing. As of April 4, 2022 they haven't replied. Until further information is made available, this project is considered as **vaporware.**
