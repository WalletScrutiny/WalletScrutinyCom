## Update 2024-10-18

This is from a twitter post made on May 30, 2024

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">First look at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Conflux?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Conflux</a>’s BSIM card in person at Consensus24! 🔥<br><br>Find our team at the conference and see it in action. <a href="https://twitter.com/Conflux_Network?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Conflux_Network</a> <a href="https://t.co/RIFc81VHuH">pic.twitter.com/RIFc81VHuH</a></p>&mdash; Cami (@CamillaCaban) <a href="https://twitter.com/CamillaCaban/status/1795931344544887193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

We'll continue to mark it as **unreleased** until new information is found.

## Product Description

The BSIM has been mentioned in an [article](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/23/first-mover-asia-blockchain-enabled-sim-card-for-crypto-investors-fuels-conflux-growth-bitcoin-holds-near-273k-after-fed-decision/) on CoinDesk: 

- It has the security of a hardware wallet.
- It can manage and store both public and private keys.
- Has 10x the storage capacity of a "traditional" sim.
- It has been described that the private key will not exit the card.
- It would allow access to Web3

## Analysis 

It is now December 2023, and apart from numerous press-releases back in May, we have not seen the device in action. 
The latest information about the {{ page.title }} is the development of open APIs for the BSIM wallet, and the introduction of BSIM account support.

We will mark this as **unreleased** until further notice. Moreover, there is a high likelihood that this is **not Bitcoin-specific**.
