The [first tweet](https://twitter.com/G999Blockchain/status/1323882311558041602) for the twitter account of the G999 blockchain was made on November 4, 2020. 

The device is specifically for the G999 coin. In short, it is an NFC enabled card, with buttons, a display and a companion app. A [video demonstration on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/G999Blockchain/videos/853963772184224) shows the transfer for G999 coins from one wallet to another.
