1. Can the private keys be created offline? - ✔️ Yes
- As demonstrated [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VxunFeDL8nU).
- The device has Air-Gap mode which completely isolates it from networks
- The information explicitly states it provides "offline storage of private keys"

2. Are the private keys shared? - **?** 
- The device keeps private keys in the secure element (EAL6+ chips)
- There may be some question regarding this [statement](https://help.onekey.so/hc/en-us/articles/11187527886095-Back-up-your-OneKey-Pro-with-OneKey-Lite) which allows the device to also backup the private keys to the {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/onekey.lite' verdict='true' %}: 
> "The OneKey Pro will search for the OneKey Lite card and transfer the **encrypted** recovery phrase securely."
- Note that the OneKey Lite can also pair with the {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/so.onekey.app.wallet' verdict='true' %}

3. Does the device display the receive address for confirmation? - ✔️ Yes. 
- From the usage instructions: "select your receive account and copy the wallet address"
- Has a 3.5-inch color touchscreen display

4. Does the interface have a display screen and buttons which allows the user to confirm transaction details? - ✔️ Yes. 
- Has a 3.5-inch IPS color touchscreen
- Transaction signing process is explicitly described with user confirmation steps
- Device shows transaction details for signing via QR codes

5. Is it reproducible? - **?**

    For now, the device is **for verification**.
