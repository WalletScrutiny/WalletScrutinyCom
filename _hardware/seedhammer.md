As of February 24, 2023, the {{ page.title }} does not have:

- a website where users could order
- a publicly available repository

It primarily does its marketing via twitter and pre-orders via twitter DM.

## Analysis

At $999, the {{ page.title }} seems to operate under a lot of secrecy. It does not have a website, online shop and conducts business primarily through pre-orders made via twitter DM. 

While the utility of a machine that can engrave QR codes and seed phrases on a stainless steel plate does seem appealling, the absence of a publicly available repository brings many questions to mind. 

One of them is - will the app's source that controls the machine, be made publicly available? 

Since many details are not yet apparent right now, this device (which is still in pre-order) is categorized as **not yet released**.
