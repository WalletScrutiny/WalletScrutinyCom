## Background 

Bluenio held a fundraiser on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1459210729/nio-card-a-smart-card-which-upgrades-your-phone-an/posts) on 2013-11-09. It was not able to raise its target amount. We can see from the [comments section](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1459210729/nio-card-a-smart-card-which-upgrades-your-phone-an/comments) that the providers were torn between marketing the device as a bitcoin payment device - or simply a multi-purpose NFC device. 

## Product Description

> A multi-purpose, Bluetooth smartcard with NFC that can make and receive Bitcoin payments and prevents the loss of your phone.

They've added Bitcoin functionality on their [6th update](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1459210729/nio-card-a-smart-card-which-upgrades-your-phone-an/posts/678441):

> As further proof of how nio Card can adapt and improve to the world, we're pleased to announced that nio Card is the world's first Bitcoin payment smartcard.
>
With a Bitcoin now worth over $1,000 USD, there is serious interest in using Bitcoin as a day-to-day currency. We’ve been working with Bitcoin experts and retailers that are already accepting it, from Pizza shops and bars to restaurants and taxi firms, to develop a simple and secure system that makes it easier than ever for people to make and accept Bitcoin payments.
>
As you know, nio Card uses Near Field Communication (NFC) to make wireless payments which are secured by a Bluetooth chain between the card and your smartphone. If the chain is broken by loss or theft, no payment can be made.

**Claimed Features**

> To receive a payment
Tap your nio card ony any NFC enabled smartphone to receive a payment
>
To make a payment

>
Unique Payment security

>
- nio Card securely stores your private keys so you can make payments. It also stores your Bitcoin address to receive payments 
- Taking payments is also easy with our Bitcoin Kiosk app

## Analysis 

The product is **vaporware**. Their website has gone offline and their social media presence has ceased making posts from April 2014.
