## Updated Review 2024-10-23

Unlike other unreleased products that we've marked as vaporware years after first finding them, this product still has an active website. The product has an actual price, that at least try to inform people that at least something is going on with the project. 

Here are a few:

> Our goal is to release the first batch of cold wallets by Q4 2024*. Pre-orders accelerate the process of development and production.
> 
> For each device pre-ordered, you will receive an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) as proof-of-purchase. At any time prior to shipping, the NFT can be sold or transferred along with ownership rights of the associated production device.
>
> Each device package will include the following items:
>
> - Hardware wallet
> - Power supply
> - Charging cable
> - Wrist lanyard
> - (1) Smartcard
> Optional accessories such as cases and holders will be available but are not included in the standard package. Orders are limited to 1 device each.

We'll wait and keep this product as **unreleased**

## Previous Review 2022-03-23

The product is still in Pre-Order. They are launching a series of [NFTs (Non-fungible tokens) on Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/tapwallet) to fund the project.

Users have the option to utilize Tapcard smart cards together with the Tapwallet to secure the private key. The Tapwallet [does not allow for the recovery of seed phrases:](http://tapwallet.com/faqs.html)

> The TAPWallet does not require storage of a 'recovery seed phrase' - which is a weak link of other hardware wallets. 

It has multi-currency support.

## Analysis 

The TAPWallet will be available late 2022.
