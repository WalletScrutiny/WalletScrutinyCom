## Brief Overview 

From their Product Overview [PDF](https://www.bitcoinpos.ch/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/BitcoinPOS_ENS.pdf)

> The customer selects a package of choice, and receives its own small server - a Bitcoin Full-Node - this server will come pre-installed and will be maintained by us. Nevertheless, you are the owner of Bitcoin and we and others do not have access to your assets. Bitcoin payments can be accepted with a standard tablet or smartphone.

Another claim is that Bitcoin lightning is supported. They also claim to offer accounting solutions together with BTCPayServer.

## Analysis 

The generic sounding Bitcoin Point of Sale from Switzerland does not list a company or a specific product. The [last tweet](https://twitter.com/bitcoin_pos/status/1151117456087441409) was made on July 16, 2019. The Telegram channel's last post is also dated 2019. There was very few information available online as its Facebook page is also not available. Nevertheless, a Point-of-Sale system **cannot be a hardware wallet**.
