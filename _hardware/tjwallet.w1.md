## Analysis 

According to the {{ page.title }} "Getting Started" [guide](https://en.tjwallet.net/getting-started/), the mnemonic phrase is displayed through the mobile app. The user then has to physically encode this on the provided *mnemonics secret box*. 

In its FAQ section, it describes a fundamental process:

> A cold wallet is just a tool for storing cryptocurrency and wallet addresses. This is designed for security reasons. You must use the software wallet to check balances and transactions. Once you have the W1 cold wallet and TJ Wallet App properly connected, you can manage your assets directly on the App.

They claim to be open source, but we could not find a link to their repository.  
The device needs the user's phone **to handle the private keys (backup words)**.
