**⚠️ Warning:** Skynance is having a private sale for its skynance token. When you click the 'Buy Now' button it redirects to a telegram group that has already expired.

Other than its appearance on its [company's whitepaper](https://www.skynanceworld.com/Whitepaper-Skynance.pdf), there are no results online for a "Skyport Hardware Wallet"

> Skyport is a Hardware wallet that will use high security technology that can only be access by the original owner

There is no release date or further information other than the image included in the whitepaper. Considering that Skynance is described as "a token built on BEP20 - Binance Smart Chain," this wallet (if it is ever released) may not support bitcoin. However, the provider is still active on social media.
