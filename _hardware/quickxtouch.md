## Wallet Creation and Private keys

The card is a primarily an NFC device which can connect with an Android phone with NFC capabilities. It has a companion app: {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/kr.co.keypair.quickxtouch2' verdict='true' %} which is [no longer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kr.co.keypair.quickxtouch2) available as of February 20, 2022. 

A third-party video tutorial on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f_NSVqzSn0) details how to create a wallet with QuickXTouch: 

- The NFC card is connected with the NFC-enabled Android phone with an installed version of {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/kr.co.keypair.quickxtouch2' %}. 
- The user then uses the phone to create a wallet and generate the backup mnemonics. 
- A wallet can be restored for as long as the user has control of the mnemonics.

## Analysis 

There are 2 other projects that are related to the QuickX Touch: The QuickX Protocol and CNexchange.io. Although the Android app is no longer available, the hardware wallet can still be ordered through its online portal.

Like most NFC cards that are reliant on a companion app on another device, the QuickX touch **risks exposure of the private key through the connected device**. There was also no mention whether the private keys are stored on a secure chip element. With no input and output interfaces, this makes the card highly dependent on the app. This risk is also made more prominent when the app is suddenly not available for download anymore.
