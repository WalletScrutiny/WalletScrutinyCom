The eliptobox was first announced on [bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=970998.msg10601510#msg10601510) on February 27, 2015. Its features were  self-described as:

> The unique feature of our wallet is the actual firewall implemented in silicon, so that every bit going in or out of the device is inspected and only valid values are passed on. The firewall separates between USB/BT and protected CryptoZone, so that a remote attacker can not change the firewall and can not compromise wallet's security.
>
> Hardware firewalls are used in enterprise as a standalone products. We are bringing the same power of deep packet inspection to the tiny mobile device (less than a credit card in size).
>
> Think of it as an offline wallet with complete independent control over the connection to the network. We provide the security of offline wallet with the features and ease of use of the conventional mobile wallets.
>
> Besides standard hardware wallet features, like private key secure storage and transaction signing with trusted verification, EliptiBox will be able to:
>
> - Store user transaction history and blockchain data on the on-board flash memory. So it can generate transactions even without active internet connection.
> - Generate random numbers from several TRNGs to enhance the quality.
> - Secure backup and restore user data by an uSD card.
> - Provide encryption and authentication services.
> - Connect to any BT4.0 device.

They had a website and a twitter account with the same name. The website has gone offline and the twitter account's last post was made on June 22, 2016. 

Following the conversation on bitcointalk, it would seem that the project's founders wanted to raise investment money for "marketing and development". Many bitcointalk members expressed skepticism and allegations of questionable marketing practices were brought up.

The product was not funded and never released.
