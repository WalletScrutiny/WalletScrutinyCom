## Product Description 

> Kastelo is a Open Source hardware wallet designed for safely storing and using Monero (XMR), a leading cryptocurrency with a focus on private and censorship-resistant transactions. Parts have been selected from manufactures that do not require a non-disclosure agreement or closed-sourced terms, so the complete production process can be transparently implemented. Hardware design documentation is provided under a CERN Open Hardware Licence to encourage knowledge sharing and dissemination. The development and funding of the project is a grassroots effort with the aim of developing a wallet design that is available for anyone to review, experiment, and improve in the interest of advancing financial freedom.

**The Kastelo [does not support BTC](https://github.com/monero-project/kastelo/issues/31).** A discussion on [Monero's reddit sub](https://old.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/ikt5ln/i_think_its_time_we_talked_about_kastelo/) indicates that it is no longer included in the Monero roadmap.
