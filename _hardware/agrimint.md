## More

> We propose a Bitcoin-based approach to democratise the creation of digital community micro-banks and deliver a full stack of financial services tailored to their needs:
>
> US dollar stablecoins and bitcoin for short and long-term saving and capital accumulation.
>
> Federated Chaumian mints for community custody and privacy-preserving current account, protected by a number of trusted community guardians.
>
> Lightning network connectivity for instant global and local payments.
>
> Multi-sig addresses secured by cheap hardware signing devices to protect the long-term capital of the community.
>
> Access via the Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) protocol on features phones without the need for internet connection.
>
> The name AgriMint is inspired by the fact that most of the communities we are aiming to serve are in rural areas and are engaged in agriculture. Mint comes from the Chaumian mint concept.
>
> These micro-banks will operate as full reserve banks and provide full transparency to their members. Moreover, due to the nature of the community custody, we believe that they can continue to operate informally, thus avoiding expensive regulations.
