On its [Telegram channel](https://t.me/Byingofficial) we read a post in 2023, we read:

Translated using Google Translate:

> Bying, [9/20/22 10:23AM]  
> Fraud incidents occur frequently, please be careful of fake official websites and fake applications!
>
> Recently, Bying found that fraud gangs induced users to open fake Bying official websites through multiple channels, which led to the theft of user assets. Fraud incidents occur frequently, and we need to continuously improve our ability to identify fake apps and official websites. Based on some security incidents that have occurred in the community recently, Bying summarizes and reminds all users here:
>
> 1. Download and install Bying, please identify Bying's only official website: https://bying.io  
> All others are fake Bying websites, please check carefully to avoid asset losses.
> 
> 2. Bying wallet currently only has a mobile client, no PC web APP. Be cautious of any URL similar to Bying's only official website (https://bying.io), and there are certain risks in downloading from non-official channels.
> 
> 3. The storage and use of private key mnemonics should not be transmitted or backed up over the Internet, because once a leak occurs, the security of assets cannot be guaranteed!
> 
> 4. Do not trust anyone who claims to be official!
> 
> 5. Private key mnemonics, etc., cannot be provided to any third party!
> 
> 6. Do not open third-party links and authorize them at will. Currently, there are many cases of asset loss caused by malicious authorization, contract transfer, private key mnemonics theft, etc.! Please be sure to improve your personal safety awareness!
> 
> 7. Finally, remind me again!!! Please look for Bying's only official website: https://bying.io

However, when we visited the website, it is no longer available and its domain has [expired since 08-28-2024](https://www.whois.com/whois/bying.io). 
With no other corroborating information that this product exists, we are marking it as **vapor** until new information comes along.
