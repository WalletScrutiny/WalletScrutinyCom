## Update 2024-10-23

Apart from the press release, there is no indication that this product ever became commercially available. As is the case with these products, you would have to email the company, get a demo, and most likely invest huge sums before this would see mass adoption. While it could be made available, right now, it is **vaporware**.

## Product Description 2023-12-07

This product was mentioned in a [press release](http://taisys.io/news-detail?lang=&id=39d4VQN4kyFspmAwER3_9V6sTZbvIP1IYQQkIBdjyw).

It is described as:

- Open Source
- With NIST FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certification
- With Android SDK for developers
- Should act as the secure element for Web3

We have not been able to find a publicly available version for sale on the web. 

We reached out to them via email at simgap <at> taisys.io, and at contact <at> taisys.com.
