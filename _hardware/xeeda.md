This hardware wallet was featured in [Forbes.com on May 18, 2018](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewrossow/2018/05/18/plugging-in-with-the-first-cold-wallet-device-for-your-smartphone/?sh=1bbfb5c97a28)

> Xeeda is the first in developing a hardware wallet that connects directly to the smartphone,” said Kevin Maloney, CEO of Xeeda. 

The pre-order was first announced on [June 6, 2018](https://twitter.com/xeedaofficial/status/1004126644129288193) via twitter.

## Private Keys

From Xeeda's homepage:

> Access to your cryptographic keys is hard-locked and stored in a secure environment. Only you have access to your keys stored on the Xeeda device. Your access keys and funds are never held by Xeeda or accessible by any third party.

## Verdict

There are a few things which seemed odd with this project that could point to the possibility of its discontinuation. The website still shows that the product is in **Pre-Order** despite several years since the announcement. Its social media channels have also been pretty quiet. Its latest twitter post was dated [January 8, 2019](https://twitter.com/xeedaofficial/status/1082663142151221248). On Telegram, the volunteer community manager expressed on August 2021:

> Guys I'm honestly not sure if this group is alive anymore. I've been the volunteer community manager for years now and I've heard nothing so I'd assume it's a dead project... I hope everyone can get past this

Xeeda's Founder and CEO [Kevin Maloney](https://coincentral.com/xeeda-kevin-maloney/), has a [linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kmaloney01/details/experience/) that does not list Xeeda as one of his job experiences. 

Until further information is made available this project would retain its last status which is **still in Pre-Order**.
