The provider released a new version. Here we try to reproduce it again, using
our {% include testScript.html %}:

```
$ ./scripts/test/hardware/passport.sh 1.0.8
...
ad6b4f5f4ae0b7e05ec35415713ea1ff7dde3edf10870876b1c8bd07391419d1  build-Passport/firmware.bin

ad6b4f5f4ae0b7e05ec35415713ea1ff7dde3edf10870876b1c8bd07391419d1  -
ad6b4f5f4ae0b7e05ec35415713ea1ff7dde3edf10870876b1c8bd07391419d1  firmware-passport-v1.0.8.bin
```

As with other hardware wallets, we did not check if those clipped bytes are
signatures or valid but leave that to actual code reviews: If the code
of the hardware wallet does what is claimed, it interprets those bytes as
signatures and checks them. In other words, if the public source code is secure,
then the link with the binary is established. This product is **reproducible**.
