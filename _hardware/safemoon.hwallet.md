## Update 2024-10-22

Based on this tweet, we can assume that the device can now be marked as **vaporware**

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SafeMoonArmy?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SafeMoonArmy</a>, a message from the SafeMoon US LLC Chapter 7 Trustee: <br><br>REMINDER: CLAIMS IN THE SAFEMOON US, LLC BANKRUPTCY ARE DUE BY JULY 22, 2024.

## Background 2022-05-17

Safemoon is a project with a BEP20 token of the same name that has recently undergone a token migration. It is [now listed as Safemoon V2.](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/safemoon-v2/) Its price is currently 0.00000001437 BTC or $0.0004398 USD. It has promised SafeMoon community members a hardware wallet (specifications unclear) since 2021. The rendering of a possible SafeMoon wallet on this page was borrowed from this [tweet](https://twitter.com/safemoon/status/1394383881789452306). 

## Analysis

The [rendering](https://twitter.com/safemoon/status/1394383881789452306) seems to portray the Safemoon Hardware wallet with a smart card form factor. In the rendering, it has a display and possibly, a touch interface. We [tweeted SafeMoon](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1526489340519428097) to ask for more information about their device. 

Note that the SafeMoon twitter account still lists this text in its profile: 

> Get on the pre-launch waitlist for the #SAFEMOONCARD now at http://safemoon.com/cardwaitlist

Since the social media presence for this project is still active, we believe this hardware wallet is **not yet released.**
