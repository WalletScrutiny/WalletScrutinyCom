EXODUS 1s aims to be the first ever mobile device with "[Bitcoin Full Node support.](https://www.htcexodus.com/us/cryptophone/exodus1s/)"

It also features an implementation of Zion Vault's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) which is meant to temporarily isolate the operating system when the user signs a transaction.

[Here is the official guide](https://www.htcexodus.com/eu/support/exodus-one-s/howto/setting-up-your-wallet.html) on how to set up the "Vault." Users are allowed to choose between an alphanumeric or a numeric passcode, and then allowed to generate and backup a 12-word recovery phrase.

## Verdict

While we did find a search tool for downloading [Kernel Source Code, Binaries and Updates for HTC Android Phones](http://www.htcdev.com/devcenter/downloads/) including the "Exodus", we could not find the source code or claims of availability of the full source code of this device making it **not verifiable**. Given it's still listed as using "Android Oreo", a five years old version of Android, we have to assume this product to be obsolete.
