## Background Information

Vaulttel ran an unsuccessful [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vaulttel/vaulttel-securing-your-digital-assets) campaign to try and raise funds for the {{ page.title }}. It was only able to raise $726 USD out of its goal of $250,000.

> The wallet will go into the SIM card tray of dual SIM Android phones or use an accessory for iPhones.

Apparently, the provider wanted to include biometric authentication as quoted from this [article](https://coingeek.com/new-hardware-wallet-can-store-crypto-in-your-phones-sim-card-slot/): 

> “Without knowing your biometric authentication, no one can transfer your coins from your hardware wallet. More than that, no spy screen recorder or Trojan can record what is happening on your hardware wallet, as it’s not using your laptop or system resources.”

## Analysis 

After the unsuccessful Kickstarter campaign, the homepage went offline. There is no evidence to suggest that this product ever made production. This is **vaporware.**
