## Update 2024-10-23

The device has not seen any major change since our last review. The last commit was made [8 months ago.](https://github.com/stakwork/sphinx-key/commit/f54cedf7168546a81d751792c46d91246923f931). This device doesn't seem to be geared for a commercial release and appears to be more of a **do-it-yourself** project.

## Product Description 2023-02-28

> A Lightning Hardware Wallet based on Validating Lightning Signer

The version 0.2.0 release offers a glimpse on the progress for the device: 

- validated lightning signing!
