## Background

Information on this wallet is taken from a single blogpost written in 2017. Online, we found no other results for "AABT X1."

An image included on the website has the box branded as "Ledger Wallet Nano," but there's no explanation on how Ledger's products are associated with "{{ page.title }}."

We found that Ledger offers ["branded wallets."](https://www.ledger.com/co-branded-partnership) This allows companies to customize Ledger wallets with custom logos, meaning that {{ page.title }} is likely not an imitation but a branded Ledger Nano.

We noted that the AABT website makes suspicious offers, including an "Auto Mining System"

> There are currently 1,800 BTC (1.2 million dollars) that are paid out to miners on a daily basis and is a unique system commonly compared to physical gold mining.
>
> At AABT we’ve made it simple and easy for anybody to take part in this mining business which was previously though to be too complex for the average person to participate. We have been actively investing in Bitcoin and other crypto currency mining gear since the beginning of 2016.

Additonally, the picture used for this "mining system" appears to [be a commonly used image of web or data servers](https://www.google.com/search?tbs=simg:CAQShgIJNWRRn3Ln1mAa-gELELCMpwgaOQo3CAQSE8op8iSxEbYzS8470znRH5ca0zwaGuMKUvE5ohZuFe5cyMQb3ruv4EV9WAToz17pIAUwBAwLEI6u_1ggaCgoICAESBHMONZgMCxCd7cEJGpsBChsKCHZlcnRpY2Fs2qWI9gMLCgkvYS80aGgzcDAKHQoKZGlzayBhcnJhedqliPYDCwoJL20vMDJmMGNqCh0KC3JlbmRlciBmYXJt2qWI9gMKCggvbS8wNmZmcAoYCgZzZXJ2ZXLapYj2AwoKCC9tLzBia3hqCiQKEm1haW5mcmFtZSBjb21wdXRlctqliPYDCgoIL20vMDUydDcM&sxsrf=APq-WBsPHlRZbZ9MTq7kizm1gl-99xSQow:1650251011862&q=aws+data+center+in+virginia&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiYs-iK0Jz3AhVow4sBHXNcC3EQ2A4oAXoECAEQNA&biw=1632&bih=922&dpr=1) with a grayscale filter.

The website also offers a "marketing plan:"

> To begin, we have decided to integrate an easy and simple binary system. Being simple and easy to earn commissions, in no time you should be able to achieve your financial goals. All you need to do is focus on building 2 teams.That’s it!
>
> The calculation method is simple. We simply calculate the number of your members in your team. When you have 3 positions on your right and 3 positions on your left, you earn a commission of 1/6 BTC All you need to do is to refer 2 friends and you will be eligible to earn commissions.

Most, if not all, activity occured around 2017. We have to assume that, because of the 5 year inactivity, this website and this "product" now qualify as defunct.
