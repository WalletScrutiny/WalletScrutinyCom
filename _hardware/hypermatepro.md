## Code and Reproducibility

On their website they link to a GitHub account that also features a repository
called [hardwallet](https://github.com/hyperpayorg/hardwallet) but it's not
clear what to make of this. There are no clear build instructions and neither
is there any version tagged. According to
[their official Twitter](https://twitter.com/Hyperpay_tech/status/1440563446681010180)
the latest version is `4.1.7` from 2021-09-22 but their repository has no such
tag. In fact it has
[no tags at all](https://github.com/hyperpayorg/hardwallet/tags).

[The commit history](https://github.com/hyperpayorg/hardwallet/commits/master)
is also rather curious. 14 commits with the last commit half a year before the
latest release `4.1.7`. That
[last commit](https://github.com/hyperpayorg/hardwallet/commit/1e9f498b69567102b2679386b7759c14be27c961#diff-30663e890bef06f6e1d74fa964e25d82781e8f95c62995ec3e3f3fd00bbf9f6a)
adds the folder `HardWalletSDK` to the project. GitHub describes the commit:

> 773 changed files with 116,778 additions and 0 deletions

The content of that folder is actually the "SDK" of
{% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/jubiterblade' verdict='true' %}:
[JubiterWallet/JubiterSDK_C](https://github.com/JubiterWallet/JubiterSDK_C)

With the missing build instructions but above all missing commits leading up to
the latest release, we find this product to be **not verifiable**.
