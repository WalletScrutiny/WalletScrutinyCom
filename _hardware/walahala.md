**Note:** The product manufacturer - or at least someone who claims to promote Walahala's product, has been flagged in [Bitcointalk forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5233706.0). Some of these include allegations of plagiarism in the Terms and Conditions, Privacy Policy and KYC policy. It is also alleged that the Owner's Manual was plagiarized from both Trezor and Ledger manuals. The product is also associated with an ICO and an exchange.

## Product Description

The provider notes that the wallet has "33 passphrases" - which they did not elaborate more on. It is certainly not BIP39 standard since BIP39 can consist of 12-24 words. 

There is an [unboxing video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_yT5vWnTfU). From the renders, it looks similar to {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/bitfreezer' verdict='true' %}. The video also claims that the device can be plugged in a Windows computer (assumedly through the USB - it was not specified) or an Android phone through an adaptor. 

It has a [companion app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.app.walahalaultimatefirstup) that is connected to the Walahala suite of products: 

> Be a WALAHALA Hardware Wallet user; a decentralized hardware wallet connected to live exchange for smart users with a better future.

They also claim that the wallet is a multi-signature wallet. 

We downloaded the app and was greeted with some infographic of some sort about Walahala's "Plasma Core Technology". The app then asked us to connect a PCB device.

## KYC for Hardware Wallet Manufacturer 

The [Walahala KYC policy](https://walahala.com/kyc)

> Walahala shall perform a KYC for every natural or legal person, representative of the legal person, beneficial owner of the user or politically exposed person (“PEP”) or a person connected with PEP.

## Verdict 

The technical specifications for the device are not forthcoming. From the few renders we see on the website, we are given the impression that it has **no interface and presumably can't confirm transactions.**

This is from the Walahala [wallet page](https://walahala.com/walahala-wallet):

> Connected to a Live Exchange on a single click
