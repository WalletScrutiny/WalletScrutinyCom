## Product Description 

The project tried to crowdfund the development and production of its multicurrency hardware wallet through [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bitcube-the-most-secure-convenient-bitcoin-wallet/coming_soon). Their website is no longer online. The upload date for their marketing videos are dated December 2018. 

## Analysis

It claims that an EAL5+ Secure Element secures the private keys. From the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-tcRilfKXs) it shows that the device has a touchscreen display which allows users to confirm transactions. not much information is available now. Since this project was not funded, we determine it to not have made production and release. This is **vaporware**.
