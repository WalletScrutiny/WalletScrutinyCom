## Product Description 

The project tried to crowdfund the development and production of its multicurrency hardware wallet through [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bitcube-the-most-secure-convenient-bitcoin-wallet/coming_soon). Their website is no longer online. The upload date for their marketing videos are dated December 2018. 

## Analysis

It claims that an EAL5+ Secure Element secures the private keys. From the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-tcRilfKXs) it shows that the device has a touchscreen display which allows users to confirm transactions. not much information is available now. Since this project was not funded, we determine it to **not have made production and release**. There are also no indications that it would continue.
