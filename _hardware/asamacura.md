What seems to be the case here is that this product was quietly discontinued and the associated domain names and social media accounts were deactivated.

Otherwise, it was [marketed as](https://www.accesswire.com/506581/ASAMACURATM-Cryptocurrency-Hard-Wallet-Available-for-Purchase-on-Amazon) a simple NFC card with **no interface** or buttons for confirming transactions.
