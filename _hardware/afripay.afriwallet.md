As of the date of this review, this product's official website [is down.](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/docs.afripay.io.html)

Here is the [archived version](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429010947/https://docs.afripay.io/afri-hardware-wallet/) from April 2021.

The site does not list any technical specifications for the hardware wallet. It claims {{ page.title }} stores private keys in an offline environment that is "controlled by a single processor chip, fully protected even should the device be plugged into a malware-infected computer."

Searching for images of {{ page.title }} online does not return any relevant pictures of the product, although we found one design of the wallet from the archived website.

## Social Media Activity

Any recent activity on Afripay's Instagram and Twitter accounts was in June 2021.

Afripay announced their token presale on Medium on the same date.


## Verdict

There is no recent news on this product. Coupled with the fact the website has gone defunct and the provider's social media is currently inactive, we have cause to assume that this product **will not be delivered or released**.
