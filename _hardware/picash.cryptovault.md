## Updated Review 2023-04-28

We've updated the review to reflect this device's lack of input/output interfaces.

## Product Description 

The PiCash Crypto Vault differentiates itself from the {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/picash.hww' verdict='true' %} with the addition of SEALED and UNSEALED states. 

Like its hardware wallet counterpart, it's a smart card that also uses a secure element to protect the private keys, 

## Analysis 

Similar to the {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/picash.hww' verdict='true' %} the PiCash Cryptovault is dependent on another product they are selling - the PiCash card reader. The card reader can be plugged to a desktop Windows/Linux/Mac computer via USB.
