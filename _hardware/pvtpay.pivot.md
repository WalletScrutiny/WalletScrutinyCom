## Preview 

The Pivot appears to be a coin-shaped hardware wallet. 

Here is the video introduction of the upcoming Indiegogo campaign:

Since this is a new product, details are still sparse and general: 

> - Authentification through your fingerprint. 
> - With an outer setting wheel and a button in the middle you can navigate through the interface of the Pivot. 
> - You can see all your funds on the display positioned right on the front over the button. Over an app you communicate over NFC with the Pivot and can easily transfer your funds. Plus it easily fits in your pocket. 

## Verdict 

The [Indiegogo page](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pvt-pay-the-rise-of-the-pivot/coming_soon) indicates that this product is "coming soon". This hardware wallet has not yet been released but from the scarce material it looks like not featuring any screen, which would make transaction signing problematic.
