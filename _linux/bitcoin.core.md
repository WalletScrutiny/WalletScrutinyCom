Bitcoin Core is the most popular continuation of the first ever Bitcoin software
by Satoshi Nakamoto which was the archival node, the wallet, the miner and even
had code for a peer-to-peer market place.

It is not only the most popular full node but also the most scrutinized and
prestigious piece of Bitcoin software to work on.
