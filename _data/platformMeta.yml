    On the Google Play Store, there are many apps that have Bitcoin in their
    name or description but don't allow the user to use Bitcoin or they don't
    look like Bitcoin wallets but turn out to be. We run our tests and document
    our findings.

    On the Apple App Store, there are many apps that have Bitcoin in their
    name or description but don't allow the user to use Bitcoin or they don't
    look like Bitcoin wallets but turn out to be. We run our tests and document
    our findings.
    
    
    WalletScrutiny started out looking only into Android. This is because
    mobile wallets are the most used wallets, and Android is the most used among
    mobile wallets, but looking into iPhone wallets was high on the list from
    the start.
    
    
    For Android, the reproducing build process is relatively clear; some apps
    did this before we started the project. For iPhone, this was not the case.
    As a result, iPhone app reproducibility was an open question.
    
    
    We asked around. Several years passed. Nobody could reproduce any iPhone
    app.
    
    
    At this point, we shift the burden of proof onto the providers (or Apple).
    If you want people to trust your app (or platform), explain how it can be
    audited. We will move on in the meantime and list iPhone apps with an empty
    reproducible section until then.

hardware:
  description: >
    There is no globally accepted definition of a hardware wallet. Some consider
    a paper with 12 words a hardware wallet - after all paper is a sort of
    hardware or at least not software and the 12 words are arguably a
    wallet(â€˜s backup).
    
    For the purpose of this project we adhere to higher standards in the
    hardware wallet section. We only consider a hardware wallet if dedicated
    hardware protects the private keys in a way that leaves the user in full and
    exclusive control of what transactions he signs or not. That means:
    
    * The device allows to create private keys offline
    * The device never shares private key material apart from an offline backup
      mechanism
    * The device displays receive addresses for confirmation
    * The device shares signed transactions after informed approval on the
      device without reliance on insecure external hardware

bearer:
  description: >
    Bearer tokens are meant to be passed on from one user to another similar
    to cash or a banking check. Unlike hardware wallets, this comes with an
    enormous "supply chain" risk if the token gets handed from user to user
    anonymously - all bearer past and present have plausible deniability if the 
    funds move. We used to categorize bearer tokens as hardware wallets, but 
    decided that they deserved an altogether different category. Generally,
    bearer tokens have these attributes:

    * Secure initial setup
    * Tamper evidence
    * Balance check without revealing private keys
    * Small size
    * Low unit price


    and either of these applies:
    
    * Somebody has a backup and needs to be trusted
    * Nobody has a backup and funds are destroyed if the token is lost or damaged
