short: Blind signing
title: Transactions are signed blindly
color: 'var(--indifferent, #3d506d)'
redflag: false
message:  Once unsealed, this device doesn't let the user verify what is being signed.
question: Can the user verify and approve transactions on the device?
details: >
  Devices in this category are first sealed. Once the seal is broken, they sign
  transactions that they are presented with but have no built-in screen to verify
  what's being signed.


  That makes them prone to malicious companion apps that they rely on for
  sending.


  While this leaves little room for major exit scams, the handling of
  such devices is delicate.


  To redeem your funds safely, create your transaction on an offline machine and
  verify the signed transaction on a different machine before broadcasting it.
