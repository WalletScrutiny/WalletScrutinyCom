question: Is it a wallet?
details: >
  If it's called "wallet" but is actually only a portfolio tracker, we don't look
  any deeper, assuming it is not meant to control funds. What has no funds, can't
  lose your coins. *It might still leak your financial history!*
  
  
  If you can buy Bitcoins with this app but only into another wallet, it's not
  a wallet itself.
