question: Does the device hide your keys from other devices?

  Some people claim their paper wallet is a hardware wallet. Others use RFID
  chips with the private keys on them. A very crucial drawback of those
  systems is that in order to send a transaction, the private key has to be
  brought onto a different system that doesn't necessarily share all the
  desired aspects of a hardware wallet.
  
  
  Paper wallets need to be printed, exposing the keys to the PC and the
  printer even before sending funds to it.
  
  
  Simple RFID based devices can't sign transactions - they share the keys
  with whoever asked to use them for whatever they please.
  
  
  There are even products that are perfectly capable of working in an
  air-gapped fashion but they still expose the keys to connected devices.
  
  
  This verdict is reserved for key leakage under normal operation and does not
  apply to devices where a hack is known to be possible with special hardware.
