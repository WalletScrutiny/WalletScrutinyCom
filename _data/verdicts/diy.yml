  Many hardware wallet projects aim to be as transparent as possible by using
  only off-the-shelf hardware with an open design and open code. If the product
  reviewed is not available in an assembled form - if the user has to source his
  own hardware to then maybe solder and compile software to install on the
  device it falls into this category.
