message: This product comes without a binary.
question: Does this product come with a binary?
details: >
  If the product is run from the source code using an interpreted language or
  the user is required to compile the binary himself, transparency is given in
  that the provided source code is what runs on the product.
  
  
  This does not mean we audited the code but any reviews of the public code are
  immediately relevant for the security of the product.


  If the provider puts your funds at
  risk on purpose or by accident, security researchers can see this if they
  care to look.
  A scammer would have to work under the potential eyes
  of security researchers. He would have to take more effort in hiding any
  exploit.
  
  
  **There is good reason to believe
  that security researchers as of today would not detect very blatant
  backdoors in the public source code before it gets exploited**, much less if
  the attacker takes moderate efforts to hide it. This is especially true for
  less popular projects.
  
  
  We feature this verdict above the "reproducible" verdict as it completely
  side-steps the issue of binary transparency. There can be no reproducibility
  issues with the next release. On the other hand, using these products might be
  more involved as compiling is required and interpreted languages like Java
  Script might be inherently less secure than other languages.
