short: Custodial!
title: 'Custodial: The provider holds the keys'

redflag: true
message: >
  As the provider of this product holds the keys, verifiability of the
  product is not relevant to the security of the funds!
question: Is the product self-custodial?
details: >
  A custodial service is a service where the funds are held by a third party
  like the provider. The custodial service can at any point steal all the
  funds of all the users at their discretion. Our investigations
  stop there.


  Some services might claim their setup is super secure, that they don't
  actually have access to the funds, or that the access is shared between
  multiple parties. For our evaluation of it being a wallet, these details are
  irrelevant. They might be a trustworthy Bitcoin bank and they might be a
  better fit for certain users than being your own bank but our investigation
  still stops there as we are only interested in wallets.


  **Products that claim to be non-custodial but feature custodial accounts without
  very clearly marking those as custodial are also considered "custodial" as a
  whole to avoid misguiding users that follow our assessment.**


  This verdict means that the provider might or might not publish source code and maybe
  it is even possible to reproduce the build from the source code but as it is
  custodial, the provider already has control over the funds, so it
  is not a wallet where you would be in exclusive control of your funds.
  
  
  We have to acknowledge that a huge majority of Bitcoiners are currently using
  custodial Bitcoin banks. If you do, please:


  * Do your own research if the provider is trust-worthy!
  
  * Check if you know at least enough about them so you can sue them when you have to!
  
  * Check if the provider is under a jurisdiction that will allow them to
    release your funds when you need them?  
  * Check if the provider is taking security measures proportional to the amount of
    funds secured? If they have a million users and don't use cold storage,
    that hot wallet is a million times more valuable for hackers to attack.
    A million times more effort will be taken by hackers to infiltrate their
    security systems.
