details: >
  Products that have been removed from the app store may have been removed temporarily 
  or permanently by the provider. This could be for any reason. This status is similar
  to 'defunct,' but more definitive since the apps were formerly present but now are not.
  They may be reinstated at any time but at the time of checking is not available.
