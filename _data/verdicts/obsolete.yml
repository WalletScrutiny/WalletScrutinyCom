  Bitcoin wallets are complex products and Bitcoin is a new, advancing
  technolgy. Projects that don't get updated in a long time are probably not
  well maintained. It is questionable if the provider even has staff at hands
  that is familiar with the product, should issues arise.
  
  
  This verdict may not get applied if the provider is active and expresses good
  reasons for not updating the product.
