  A wallet that claims to not give the provider the means to steal the users'
  funds might actually be lying. In the spirit of *"Don't trust - verify!"*
  you don't want to take the provider at his word, but trust that people
  hunting for fame and bug bounties could actually find flaws and back-doors
  in the wallet so the provider doesn't dare to put these in.


  Back-doors and flaws are frequently found in closed source products but some
  remain hidden for years. And even in open source security software there
  might be
  [catastrophic flaws](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list.php?vendor_id=97&product_id=585&version_id=&page=1&hasexp=0&opdos=0&opec=0&opov=0&opcsrf=0&opgpriv=0&opsqli=0&opxss=0&opdirt=0&opmemc=0&ophttprs=0&opbyp=0&opfileinc=0&opginf=0&cvssscoremin=0&cvssscoremax=0&year=0&month=0&cweid=0&order=3&trc=98&sha=cf091948bd7a20cd650cfc7fb718a5f4400a6d71)
  undiscovered for years.


  An evil wallet provider would certainly prefer not to publish the code, as
  hiding it makes audits orders of magnitude harder.


  For your security, you thus want the code to be available for review.


  If the wallet provider doesn't share up to date code, our analysis stops
  there as the wallet could steal your funds at any time, and there is no
  protection except the provider's word.


  **"Up to date" strictly means that any instance of the product being updated
  without the source code being updated counts as closed source.** This puts the
  burden on the provider to always first release the source code before
  releasing the product's update. This paragraph is a clarification to our rules
  following
  [a little poll](https://twitter.com/WalletScrutiny/status/1408933028227956736).


  We are not concerned about the license as long as it allows us to perform our
  analysis. For a security audit, it is not necessary that the provider allows
  others to use their code for a competing wallet. You should still prefer
  [actual open source licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Source_Definition)
  as a competing wallet won't use the code without giving it careful scrutiny.
