  The best hardware wallet cannot guarantee that the provider deleted the

  There is no way of knowing if the provider took a copy in the process. If they
  did, all funds controlled by those devices are potentially also under the control
  of the provider and could be moved out of the client's control at any time at
  the provider's discretion.
