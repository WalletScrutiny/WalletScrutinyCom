question: Are the keys never shared with the provider?
details: >
  The best hardware wallet cannot guarantee that the provider deleted the
  keys if the private keys were put onto the device by them in the first place.
  
  
  There is no way of knowing if the provider took a copy in the process. If they
  did, all funds controlled by those devices are potentially also under the control
  of the provider and could be moved out of the client's control at any time at
  the provider's discretion.
