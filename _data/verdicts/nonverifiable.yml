message: We could not verify that the provided code matches the binary!
question: Is the published binary matching the published source code?
details: >
  Published code doesn't help much if it is not what the published binary was
  built from. That is why we try to reproduce the binary. We

  1. obtain the binary from the provider

  1. compile the published source code using the published build instructions into a binary

  1. compare the two binaries

  1. we might spend some time working around [issues that are easy to work around](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/110237303)


  If this fails, we might search if other revisions match or if we can
  deduct the source of the mismatch but generally consider it on the provider to
  provide the correct source code and build instructions to reproduce the build,
  so we usually open a ticket in their code repository.


  In any
  case, the result is a discrepancy between the binary we can create and the binary
  we can find for download and any discrepancy might leak your backup to the
  server on purpose or by accident.
  
  
  As we cannot verify that the source provided is the source the binary was
  compiled from, this category is only slightly better than **closed source**
  but for now we have hope projects come around and fix verifiability issues.
