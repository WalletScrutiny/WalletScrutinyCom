  Chaumian eCash is a form of electronic token system that provides some privacy
  benefits but requires trust in mint operators. While the technology itself is
  promising, wallets implementing it effectively connect to custodial services.
  
  
  There are currently two main incompatible protocols for Chaumian eCash:
  
  
  * Cashu
  * Fedimint
  
  
  While these systems aim to enable what could be called "fist-reach custody" (where
  users have physical access to their custodians, like a trusted family member),
  wallets cannot enforce this model. We are seeing users gravitate towards popular
  mints rather than local ones, which defeats the intended trust model.
  
  
  Even in an ideal "Uncle Jim" scenario where users know their mint operator
  personally:
  
  
  * The mint operator can still lose or steal the funds
  * The mint could be compromised by hackers
  * The mint operator could face regulatory pressure
  * Technical issues could result in loss of funds
  
  
  While Chaumian eCash may serve valid use cases, users should understand that:
  
  
  * They are trusting the mint operator with custody of their funds
  * They should ideally use local mints operated by people they know and can reach
  * The privacy benefits come at the cost of giving up self-custody
  * The tokens are only as good as the mint operator's promise to redeem them
