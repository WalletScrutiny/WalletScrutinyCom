question: Can the product be built from the source provided?
details: >
  Published code doesn't help much if the app fails to compile.

  
  We try to compile the published source code using the published build
  instructions into a binary. If that fails, we might try to work around issues
  but if we consistently fail to build the app, we give it this verdict and
  open an issue in the issue tracker of the provider to hopefully verify their
  app later.
