question: Can it send and receive bitcoins?
details: >
  If it is for holding BTC but you can't actually send or receive them with this
  product then it doesn't function like a wallet for BTC but you might still be
  using it to hold your bitcoins with the intention to convert back to fiat
  when you "cash out".
  
  
  All products in this category are custodial and thus funds are at the mercy of
  the provider.
