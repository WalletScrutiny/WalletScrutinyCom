question: Can it send and receive bitcoins?
details: >
  If it is for holding BTC but you can't actually send or receive them with this
  product then it doesn't function like a wallet for BTC but you might still be
  using it to hold your bitcoins with the intention to convert back to fiat
  when you "cash out".
