redflag: false
message: This verdict may change pending updated analysis.
question: Does our review and verdict apply to their latest release?
details: >
  Verdicts apply to very specific releases of products and never to the product
  as a whole. A new release of a product can change the product completely and
  thus also the verdict. This product remains listed according to its latest
  verdict but readers are advised to do their own research as this product might
  have changed for the better or worse.
  
  
  This meta verdict is applied in cases of reviews that we identify as
  requiring an update.
  
  
  This meta verdict applies to all products with verdict "reproducible" as soon
  as a new version is released until we test that new version, too. It also
  applies in cases where issues we opened are marked as resolved by the
  provider.
    
  
  If we had [more resources](/donate), we would update reviews more timely
  instead of assigning this meta verdict ;)
