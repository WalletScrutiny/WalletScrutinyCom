message: The binary provided was reproducible from the code provided.
question: Does the binary we built differ from what we downloaded?
details: >
  If we can reproduce the binary we downloaded from the public source code, with
  all bytes accounted for, we call the product reproducible. This does not mean we audited
  the code but it's the precondition to make sure the public code has relevance for the
  provided binary.


  If the provider puts your funds at
  risk on purpose or by accident, security researchers can see this if they
  care to look. It also means that inside the company, engineers can verify
  that the release manager is releasing the product based on code known to all
  engineers on the team. A scammer would have to work under the potential eyes
  of security researchers. He would have to take more effort in hiding any
  exploit.
  
  
  "Reproducible" does not mean "verified". **There is good reason to believe
  that security researchers as of today would not detect very blatant
  backdoors in the public source code before it gets exploited**, much less if
  the attacker takes moderate efforts to hide it. This is especially true for
  less popular projects.
