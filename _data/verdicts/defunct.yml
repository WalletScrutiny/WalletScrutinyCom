question: Is the product still supported by the still existing provider?
details: >
  Discontinued products or worse, products of providers that are not active
  anymore, are problematic, especially if they were not formerly reproducible
  and well audited to be self-custodial following open standards. If the
  provider hasn't answered inquiries for a year but their server is still
  running or similar circumstances might get this verdict, too.
