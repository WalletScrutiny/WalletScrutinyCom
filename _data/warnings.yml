    This app might download hundreds of GB of data and thus is not suited for
    use on a metered internet connection. Depending on your network speed, you
    might also have to wait a long time for certain interactions.
defaultProviderApi:

  message: >
    By default, this wallet connects to servers of the provider to query
    transactions and balances. The provider can log all addresses of all your
    accounts. Although providers normally promise not to do so, it is hard to
    know for sure. Things that can be done about this issue:
    
    ### Use compact block filters
    
    Compact block filters (for example
    [BIP158](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0158.mediawiki))
    allow you to download an "index" of all transactions that allows you to then
    download only full blocks relevant to you. This is slower than asking a
    powerful server for your balance and transactions but if done right, it is
    very private.
    
    ### Use your own backend server
    
    Some providers let you configure your own bitcoin full node, electrum server
    or other product that can make quick transaction look-ups for you. Using
    your own server, you can control what gets logged and what not.

    By default this wallet queries random full nodes for your transactions. For
    this to work, it has to send all your addresses to those full nodes. By some
    estimates, half of publicly reachable full nodes are run by Blockchain
    Analysis companies. These companies collect data on Bitcoin transactions and
    sell those to interested parties like exchanges, tax authorities, law
    enforcement etc. To improve your privacy

    The supported liquid network might degrade to a quasi custodial wallet [as
    has happened in the

2of2timeoutSig:
  privacyAlert: medium
  short: 2of2 signature feature has negative side effects
  message: >
    The wallet provides a security feature that allows you to define spending
    limits so a thief cannot empty your wallet without a server of the provider
    approving this transaction. While this feature can help save your funds, it
    also comes at a cost:
    
    * Your transaction history is necessarily known to the provider.
    
    * Your transaction history is mostly visible on the blockchain as your
    change output goes to this very special script again.
      
    * Your funds might be temporarily locked when you urgently need them.
    
    * The feature only works if you roll funds over: If you go without doing any
    transactions for a while, you also lose the benefits until you do a new
    transaction.
      
    * Transactions are more expensive as the more complicated script requires
    more space on the blockchain.
      
    * Funds protected by this feature cannot be discovered by any other wallet.
    As the wallet is fully transparent, this could be worked around in case that
    the provider went away from one day to the other.
      
    There is a misconception that this feature would allow the provider to hold
    the users' funds ransom but to our knowledge this is not the case as it is
    a 2-of-2 script with a timeout after which the server's key is not needed
    anymore.
