Florian Klien made a derivative work based on the [Piper Wallet](https://web.archive.org/web/20160309032223/http://cryptographi.com/) in 2014. It is [Open Source](https://github.com/piperwallet/Piper), but the code is no longer maintained. It consisted of the following components: 

> - Thermal printer
> - Raspberry Pi
> - Treasure chest
> - Button: 
> - 3000mA/5V power supply: 
> - SD card: 

The device allows for the creation of private keys offline. The only way the private key is shared is through the print out. The device does not have a display that allows for the confirmation of transactions. Rather than the device being a conventional hardware wallet, we could describe it as a device that prints out the public and private keys on a piece of paper. As it is a paper wallet generator and has no other way of securing the printed keys, we will classify it as such.
