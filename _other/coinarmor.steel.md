## Background 

This Kickstarter project was launched on January 4, 2018. The project was supported by [71 backers who pledged $2,177](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/437309334/coin-armor-steel-cryptocurrency-wallet/posts) to help fund the project. The {{ page.title }} was cross-posted on [bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2689639.0).  

## Product Description 

The front side of the card-sized metal plate includes a QR code of the public key. 
The backside has a BIP-38 compliant engraved QR code of the private key. 

> In Coin Armor private key is BIP 38 encrypted. What does it mean? 
>
> BIP 38 is a method proposed for encrypting and encoding a passphrase-protected Bitcoin private key record in the form of a 58-character Base58Check-encoded printable string. Encrypted private key records are intended for use on paper wallets and physical Bitcoins. Each record string contains all the information needed to reconstitute the private key except for a passphrase, and the methodology uses salting and scrypt to resist brute-force attacks.

## Analysis 

The Kickstarter was successfully funded. Some people complained they did not receive their coin armor and some people gave positive reviews. The use of BIP38 removes having to trust the provider as the user retains an encryption key, with the "printed" key being encrypted and useless without that key. The problem is though that to use this wallet you have to produce the private key on an online wallet which might intercept the key and steal the funds.

We were not able to find traces of any commercial activity with the same branding afterwards. But there are numerous similar products with different brands.
