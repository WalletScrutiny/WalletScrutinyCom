### For local development

This is for you if you want to make changes. It starts a server that you can
reach at localhost:4000 and when you change a source file, it automatically
compiles the project and you should see the changes when refreshing the browser.

Each build takes around 7s.

```
npx gulp serve
```

or

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --profile --trace
```

### For production deployment

This will also minify the html, css and js which takes all in all about 50s. The
result can be found in the `_site/` folder and uploaded to your web server.

```
npx gulp
```
