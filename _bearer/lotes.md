"Lotes" are described as physical bitcoin notes that run on the *Lightning Network.*

On the [Stacker News thread](https://stacker.news/items/157596) introducing this product, a user asked what was the difference between "Lotes" and bolt card. The reply was:

> You top-up bolt card and then spend from it on LN terminals.
>
> This is meant to be cash-like. So you top it up and then pass this card to someone else. So this receiver doesn't need anything only trust in you.. And once he doesn't want to trust you he can use this Lotes app to validate the bank note. (check if it is really topped) 


## From our understanding...

[Lotes work by communicating with an LNBits wallet through the use of NFC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cQutic0CX0). Lotes can be used as a means to send and receive sats. To send a Lote:

- Issue the Lote - specify the amount of satoshis you want the note to "hold."
- Record the Lote to a physical NFC chip.
- The receiver must open his app and hit "Claim Lote." He must scan the chip on which the Lote was recorded on.
- The sats will arrive in the receiver's wallet.

Along with the fact there's no official store, product, or specifications in sight, we assume that "Lotes" are only **DIY products** that need the Lotes app to "write" information onto the chip. As of this date, the app is only available for beta testers on the App Store.
