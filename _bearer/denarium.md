## Background

Denarium picked up where {% include walletLink.html wallet='bearer/casascius' verdict='true' %} left off in 2015. Similar to its predecessor, Denarium made use of sealed private keys covered by a hologram sticker. The mini private key would then have to be imported to another device in order to be used.
