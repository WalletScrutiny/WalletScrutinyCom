## Background

Denarium picked up where {% include walletLink.html wallet='bearer/casascius' verdict='true' %} left off in 2015. Similar to its predecessor, Denarium made use of sealed private keys covered by a hologram sticker. The mini private key would then have to be imported to another device in order to be used.

## Analysis 

The user manual could be accessed [here.](https://denarium.com/user-manual/index.html)

> All our bitcoin wallets have a Bitcoin private key inside the coin, we use a 30-character mini private key format. Each private key is printed only once and for security reasons we **directly supervise** each phase of product assembly that involves the handling of private keys.

Denarium mentioned that they also have two series' of coins: the E-series and the L-series. The E-series are not pre-loaded with Bitcoin. 

Based on the description, all of their coins' private keys involve the inspection by the CEO, Henry Brade, the CPO, Viljami Räisä, or both. This makes the product **prefilled.**
