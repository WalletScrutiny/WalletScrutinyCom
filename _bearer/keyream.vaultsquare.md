## Product Description 

The website for the device is down. Most social media accounts have been inactive since August 24, 2019. 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GH7Cfs7aD54" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The device seems to be a laser etched QR code containing the public keys. We do not have information on where the private keys are stored. 

## Analysis 

We reached out to Keyream via the email address displayed on their Facebook page. For the meanwhile, we'll mark this as no longer in production and as a work-in-progress until further information is available.

As of March 23, 2023, they haven't replied to our email.
