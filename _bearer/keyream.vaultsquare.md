## Product Description 

The website for the device is down. Most social media accounts have been inactive since August 24, 2019. 

The device seems to be a laser etched QR code containing the public keys. We do not have information on where the private keys are stored. 

## Analysis 

We reached out to Keyream via the email address displayed on their Facebook page. For the meanwhile, we'll mark this as no longer in production and as a work-in-progress until further information is available.
