## Addendum 2022-03-19

The Sugi card is very similar to {% include walletLink.html wallet='bearer/satodime' verdict='true' %}. It has NFC, has a secure element for authentication and has a companion app. Although it is marketed primarily as a "NFC wallet card", it can function with the intention of passing it to another user. 

## Previous Review 2021-08-08

The Sugi card lacks a screen or a button, this device cannot provide basic security of hardware wallets.
