## Background Information 

The Goldex project is associated with the [Goldex Token](https://etherscan.io/contractdiffchecker?a1=0xc631120155621ee625835ec810b9885cdd764cd6) (GLDX). 

## Product Description 

The Goldex card is an NFC hot/cold card. It has a [companion app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.denxpro.plus). 

Its features include: 

> When the user has a GPLUS physical card, it becomes a hot wallet, the user has the authority to design the card and can use it as a cold or hot wallet thanks to the specified 12-word password or private key.
>
> In addition, in case the determined password is forgotten, thanks to the NFC infrastructure, the user can access the device without the need for a contactless password with the phone paired with the card.
> 
> This technology can easily contact our company in case the phone, card or e-mail address of the user is stolen, freeze their assets without losing them and continue to preserve their assets.

## Analysis 

We were able to login to the [Goldex interface](https://goldexplus.com/app/). The primary denomination in the dashboard is **BUSD and GLDX**. There is **no Bitcoin**. 

The [Goldex Documentation](https://goldexplus.gitbook.io/goldexplus/)

> The commitment that our Goldexplus.com users must accept is to have GLDX tokens and farm these tokens for 360 days. Please follow the steps below to apply for a goldexplus.com physical card.

Apart from that the cards have no display or interface. Finally, what gave us some concern the most was this statement from their twitter account:

The provider has the capability to freeze funds.
