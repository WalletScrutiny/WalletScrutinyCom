## Background

Alitin Mint coins were a limited edition of physical bitcoins. Here is some information about the product from [the archived official site:](https://web.archive.org/web/20160220174536/https://www.alitinmint.com/)

> These pieces are a combination of physical bitcoin, pure bullion, and limited edition art pieces by presidential sculptor, John B. Andelin. We are continuing to take physical bitcoins to the next level! Each coin is personally signed by the artist and sealed in a tamper proof casing. Each coin is also embedded with physical bitcoin, with private key engraved on the edge, out of view unless sealed case is broken.

An external site called [Coin Community](https://wiki.coin.community/Alitin_Mint) had a short page concerning these coins, mentioning how there was a transaction that "moved nearly 36 bitcoin from 18 Adam Smith coins." [Here is a link to the transaction.](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/71c46a6af0ff85f770f449bc2d2ee1aaa796fafbec4ad138f8fd06c3289011e2) This event took place on February 26, 2017. Shortly afterward, Alitin Mint reopened its website and [made a notice concerning the missing BTC.](https://web.archive.org/web/20170326152145/http://www.alitinmint.com/) Here is their thread discussing the matter on [BitcoinTalk.](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1815933.0)

## Verdict

Although the coins were placed in a "tamper-proof casing," the keys were **prefilled** and engraved on the edge of the coin. Users could seal the coin away in a secure place, but they wouldn't be able to know if the provider had taken a copy beforehand.

The website is now unavailable and it is unlikely that the coins will be in production again. As such, we can conclude it is **defunct.**
