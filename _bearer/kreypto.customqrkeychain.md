## Background 

The project was featured in [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/899547039/kreypto-custom-qr-crypto-keychains/description) on **June 24, 2018**. It was not able to successfully raise its target of $31,539. It was only able to raise $85.

## Product Description 

> A simple, smart and elegant keychain that lets you receive and send cryptocurrencies with just one scan. Think of it as your crypto ID, which allows you to trade easily in a few seconds, and is 100% safe since no currencies are stored on it. 
> 
We use 3D printing with top edge laser cutting technology to create the most unique products with methacrylate, aluminum, and steel sheets. We are also looking into new products and new materials are being tested weekly to improve our offer and constantly bring you more value. 
>
The QR printed in our products are the direct code to receive and send cryptocurrencies. We transform your public receiving code into the QR itself, so it becomes simple to transfer cryptocurrencies.

## Analysis 

There was no mention of how the provider treats the private keys - only the public keys. The product was never launched and the domain kreypto.com was never registered. There are no social media imprints for this project. This product is **vaporware**.
