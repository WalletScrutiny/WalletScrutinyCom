This item is pretty straightfoward. It's a card with the public key in its front and the private key at the back. The private key is hidden with a seal which could be scratched off when needed. 

> Wallet cards are a secure way to store coins. The plastic cards are water proof and more durable than paper wallets. The wallet cards are made from photo-quality standard blank PVC cards. The white 100% PVC blank cards are vision inspected and printed with dye sublimation technology for full color printing then protected with a clear overlay, and thermal resin printing on the back for durability and easy scanning of the QR code. A holographic scratch off sticker conceals the private key QR code.

From the FAQ: 

> What is a wallet card?
> 
> A wallet card is a way to store crypto coins by printing the public and private keys on a plastic card. This “cold storage” method keeps your coins safe from hackers and malware that attempt to steal your private key from your computer. However, since the private key is on the card, the card itself must be kept safe.
>
> If I lose my card, can you send me the private key?
> 
> To ensure maximum security, private keys are not saved. When the card is made, the public and private keys are created on a computer without access to the internet and then sent to the printer. The printed card is the only copy of the private key. If it’s lost, there is no way to recover it.
>
> Does the card come with coins already loaded?
> 
> At this time, all the cards sold contain a 0 balance. 

## Verdict 

Both the public keys and the private keys are **printed by the provider** prior to reaching the user.
