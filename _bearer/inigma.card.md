## Background 

The Taiwanese team for the {{ page.title }} launched a successfully funded [Kickstarter project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/inigmacard/inigma-card/description) from March 3, 2020 to May 7, 2020. Of its $15,000 goal, they raised $16,788. 

However, they [announced](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/inigmacard/inigma-card/posts/3057730) on December 31, 2020 that due to "unexpected difficulties" they were going to "suspend operations in 2021". 

The company is also known as "Inigma Blockchain Services" on its Google Play page.

Their home page is no longer available but is still accessible via [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20200803150735/https://www.inigmasys.com/)

## Companion Apps

## Analysis 

Without a display or an interface by which the user can physically verify or approve transactions, the device would **heavily rely on the mobile phone companion apps for the transaction**. 

There's no mention or documentation for either the Android or the iOS app. It was also not mentioned whether the project was Open Source. 

Although the company was able to release some prototypes on December 8, 2020, the announcement of the suspension of the company's activities lend us to believe that this product has been obsoleted.
