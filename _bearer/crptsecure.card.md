## Analysis 

There are some elements to the service that we have questions about. We [reached out on twitter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1511873887034044419) to the founder and await a response. We have a certain unease about **sending seed phrases (of all things!) to another entity** even though they may claim it is encrypted. This unease is further aggravated by the feeling of paying them a monthly non-refundable fee with a very long contractual agreement. This is a relatively new service so we'll await their clarification. Until then we'll maintain that **sending seed phrases to a third party app**, even for safe-keeping and retrieval is problematic.
