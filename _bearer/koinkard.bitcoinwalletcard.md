## Background 

The {{ page.title }} tried to raise money via [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/111829753/bitcoin-wallet-card/description) but failed. 

## Product Description 

It's described as: 

> Hard plastic professionally printed bitcoin wallets with your own wallet address. Corresponding QR code included $5 SHIPS FREE.
> 
KoinKard will be creating custom bitcoin wallets for everyone at an affordable price with Free shipping. Each card will have it's own QR code generated to correspond directly with the Bitcoin wallet address you provide us. These are hard plastic cards like gift cards that are professionally printed with your custom generated QR code and bitcoin wallet address. Unlike paper, It won't get messed up and you will have 1 KoinKard shipped to your door for only $5. 

## Analysis 

The {{ page.title }} was not funded and is **vaporware**. If it made it to market, the issue would probably have been the lack of private keys on the card. Being just a carrier for your Bitcoin address, it was designed to show a fancy card to receive Bitcoins to a fixed address without having to pull out  an electronic device, making it **not a wallet**.
