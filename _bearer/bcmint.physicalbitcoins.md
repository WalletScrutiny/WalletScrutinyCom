## Background

From their [blog post](https://bcmint.com/blogs/news/introducing-the-bcmint).

> COLD STORAGE WALLET Physical Bitcoins have the bitcoin address and QR code cleanly displayed on the reverse of the coin on a tamper-evident secure hologram.  Opening the hologram sticker will reveal the private keys.
>
> The secure key-pair process is supervised by our Managing Director; whereas the keys are printed and records destroyed using [Casascius bitcoin address](https://github.com/casascius/Bitcoin-Address-Utility/find/master) utility offline.
>
> The plan for the BCmint is to produce a primary line of Physical Bitcoin and evolve this over time. Additionally a trustless two factor authorization coin will be available, as well as some custom coins whereas company logos or art can be included in the tamper evident hologram foil.

Security 

> Key-pairs are generated in a secure room from offline computers under supervision of the Treasury Director. All data is destroyed at the end of each Minting run, and all systems are reformatted. We are also pleased to offer trust-less advanced 2 factor authorization multisig option (P2SH).

Unfunded Coins 

> The Physical Bitcoin is an offline cold storage wallet. To fund your coin, you will need to purchase digital Bitcoin (BTC) from an exchange. 

## Analysis 

Who is the "Managing Director" or the "Treasury Director" and why should we trust him/her? Nevertheless, it was not specified if their process adheres to BIP-38. So the private key may be in its raw form. At most, these tokens can serve as souvenirs.
