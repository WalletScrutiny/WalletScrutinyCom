## Background 

> Laser Eyes Bolt Cards are compatible with the Bolt Card Standard and with your favourite bolt card service.

This is practically a branded version of {% include walletLink.html wallet='bearer/lnbits.boltcard' verdict='true' %}.

Similar to the LN Bits Bolt Card, the Laser Eyes Bolt Card, have the same [instructions.](https://lasereyes.cards/how-to-use/lnbits-bolt-card-setup-instructions/)

## Analysis 

Setting-up the cards requires the following software:

 - LN Bits Bolt Card extension
 - [Bolt Card NFC programming app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lightningnfcapp)
 - [NXP NFC Tag Writer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nxp.nfc.tagwriter)

 The private keys are stored on the paired wallet app, which are then presumably kept on the LNBits server and not stored on the cards.
