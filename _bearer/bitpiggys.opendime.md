## Product Description 

The actual product was meant as an educational tool for parents and their children. Children could put real fiat coins as well as scan Bitcoin satoshis via printed QR codes with the public keys. Once the user wants to transfer funds, the private key is then accessed through the accompanying {% include walletLink.html wallet='bearer/opendime' verdict='true' %}.

## Analysis 

The product's website bitpiggys.com now redirects to shamory.com. Though the actual piggy bank is no longer for sale, acquiring an Opendime is still possible. The same verdict of **"sealed-plainkeys"** given to Opendime, is applied.
