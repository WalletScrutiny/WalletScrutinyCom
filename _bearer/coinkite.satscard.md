## Product [FAQ](https://getsatscard.com/faq)

> What is SATSCARD™?<br />
> - Like cash in hand, pass physical Bitcoin along multiple times. Gift. Anonymous. Trust no one.
> - SATSCARD is new type of OPENDIME® in an NFC card form factor with ten times the reuse capacity.
> - Gift and trade Bitcoin physically; maximize in person trading while minimizing trust between parties.

**How do I unseal it to reveal the Bitcoin?**
> You need a companion app on a mobile phone to run the unseal command. It will ask for the spending code, a 6-digit card verification code (CVC), to authorize the change.

**Do I need this paper envelope it came in?**
> Yes! That's a special radio frequency (RF) blocking sleeve. It prevents unwanted access by RF readers with bad intentions. Be sure to insert the SATSCARD fully into the sleeve: even 5 mm sticking out can allow a sneaky reader to get a signal.

**Can I use a SATSCARD with a computer (desktop, laptop)?**
> Yes! You need a USB NFC card reader and the cktap command-line software. Or any desktop wallet that uses our open protocol.

**Why multiple slots?**
> The original OPENDIME had a single private key, and once unsealed, that's that. With ten slots, you can use a SATSCARD over and over.

**Does this replace my existing Bitcoin wallet?**
> No, you still would need a third-party wallet or Bitcoin Core to move your funds in and out of the SATSCARD.

**How do I get funds out?**
> 1. Unseal the current slot (factory default slot is zero) and export the WIF.
> 2. Import the WIF into a wallet on the blockchain and sweep the funds.

**Is the private key unique and secret?**
> Yes. SATSCARD comes with a private key for slot zero only. You can supply entropy (random numbers) to generate keys for the remaining slots as you use them. The factory-generated address is made from the block hash (at the "birth height" of the card) and a random number that never leaves the card.

**How do I see the deposit address?**
> The first slot is pre-programmed, so using the QR code on the back of the card will send funds to the first slot.

## Analysis 

As of today, April 14, 2022 the Satscard is **yet to be released**. However at the interim, there are several concerns that arise. One of them is addressed by CoinKite itself in their own FAQ: the **RF blocking sleeve.** 

Quoted:

> It prevents unwanted access by RF readers with bad intentions. Be sure to insert the SATSCARD fully into the sleeve: even 5 mm sticking out can allow a sneaky reader to get a signal.

Up to what extent is a "sneaky RF reader" with bad intentions able to do damage to the contents of a card?  

Another is the **lack of a display or of an interface** to the cards. We do understand that they're meant to be handed over physically to another person however we also recognize that requiring a mobile phone app, or another computer system with an NFC card reader in order for the receiving party to verify the contents of a card does pose some risks.
