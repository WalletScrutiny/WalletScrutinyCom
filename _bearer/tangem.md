Tangem Wallet and {% include walletLink.html wallet='bearer/tangemnote' verdict='true' %} are from the same providers.

{% include walletLink.html wallet='bearer/tangemnote' %} is described as being ["for those who are new to crypto."](https://shop.tangem.com/products/tangem-note) while Tangem Wallet is advertised as:

> [A multicurrency hardware wallet to manage various crypto with access to DeFi, NFT, DeEx and more – all in one card.](https://shop.tangem.com/products/tangem-wallet)

Notably, a single Tangem Note only supports one cryptocurrency while Tangem Wallet supports multiple currencies. Otherwise, there's not many clear distinctions between the cards. Both products require {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.tangem.wallet' %} to send and receive cryptocurrency.

Tangem Wallet **lacks an input or output interface** that could confirm a transaction independent from a companion app when redeeming the funds.
