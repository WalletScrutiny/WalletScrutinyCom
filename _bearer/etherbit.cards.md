## Background 

Etherbit is an Indian reseller of various cryptocurrency hardware devices. They are [official resellers](https://www.etherbit.in/pages/faq) for Trezor, Ledger, Safepal, Cryptotag and more and provide back-links from these manufacturers to verify this fact.

From the [description](https://www.etherbit.in/products/etherbit-card):

> Etherbit cards are 'physical Ether'. They're a quick and convenient way to give ether, tokens, or other blockchain assets to friends and family, and a great way to introduce people to the power of the Ethereum blockchain.

## Product Description 

> How do Etherbit Cards work?
>
1. Get your Etherbit Card
2. Buy them from Etherbit with free shipping.
3. Load your card with tokens or Ether
4. Load your Etherbit Card from any wallet that supports scanning QR codes.
5. Give it as a gift
6. The card can be redeemed using My Ether Wallet.
>
> Behind-the-scenes
>
> Each card has its own unique Ethereum address, printed on the back in QR code and text form, and a private key, hidden under a scratch-off panel. To use one, simply scan the code, deposit some Ether or tokens using your favourite wallet app, and give it to the lucky recipient.
>
> When they want to redeem it, they can scratch off the panel, and use their own wallet app to 'sweep' the funds into their newly created account.
>
> Each unscratched card's security is guaranteed by a smart contract.
> 
> Redeem your Etherbit card using My Ether Wallet
>
> Go to www.myetherwallet.com, and click "Send Ether". Under "Select the format of your private key", choose "Mnemonic Phrase". Enter the phrase on the back of your card, and click "Unlock".
>
> You will be shown information about your Etherbit Card account, including account balances, and a form to send funds to other Ethereum accounts. You can also send tokens using "Send Tokens" in the menu at the top of the screen.
>
> We highly recommend generating a new wallet - either using My Ether Wallet, or the client of your choice - and transferring your funds onto that account.

## Analysis 

As the description states, these cards are meant to be handed from one user to another. They do not have a display. They claimed in 2018, that they would be supporting BTC "[sometime in the future](https://www.etherbit.in/products/etherbit-card)". However, we have yet to see evidence for this. We believe that these cards **do not currently support BTC**.
