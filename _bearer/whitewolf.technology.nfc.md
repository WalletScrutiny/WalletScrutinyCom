## Analysis 

The product has no product page, and no links to a GitHub repository. The single page on the site describes the process of using the cards.

  > It's an authentication token not able to sign transactions or even hold private bitcoin keys. It can be used in conjunction with a wallet to proof the presence of the device. A TAN generator basically.

This is **not a bitcoin wallet**.
