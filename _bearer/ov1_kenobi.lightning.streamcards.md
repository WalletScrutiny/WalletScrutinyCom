## Product Information

This is a **work-in-progress** item entered into the Bolt.Fun website. 

> Creating NFC cards with LN addresses, NOSTR Nip 05 identifiers, and accounts on Fountain, Vida, & Lightning.Video to act as lightning rods for content consumers brought in through Iris, Damus, & Amethyst NOSTR clients filling the sails under a Bitcoin Standard by zapping sats into Wallet of Satoshi, Breez.tech, Alby, & Bolt Card wallets. Programming them to receive streaming payments funneled through LN Bits extensions fed w/LN sats from live & recorded audio & video feeds.
>
> This personalized LN/Nostr ID card can also be issued as branded company ID/Payroll/Expense account funding cards, that can be programmed to provide granular access to events online and in person, with varying levels of access granted to Management/Staff/VIPs/General Admission participants in one-time events or ongoing business operations. Think Costco Membership Card meets prepaid Mastercard meets Payroll/Stipend/Retail payment card, with a unique public/private communication system built in through the Nostr protocols.
>
> These branded cards can be issued as Proof of Attendance at live events, becoming a functional, not just decorational, form of Proof of Work timestamping entry into the ecosystem. Historically, this was done for live concert tours when the band's t-shirts could only be purchased at the live shows. This PoA could then enable immediate and ongoing communication between all attendees, can be made searchable and authenticatible with an ordinal tying an inscription containing the text files of the Nostr IDs given to all who participated.
