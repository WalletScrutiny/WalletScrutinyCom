## Background 

Sony CSL made the [announcement](https://www.sonycsl.co.jp/press/prs201810-2/) in October 2018 that they developed a cryptocurrency card based on their existing IC (Integrated Circuit) card technology.

> The IC card type hardware wallet is small, portable and useful, unlike typical existing hardware wallets that connect to PCs via USB. In addition, it is possible to securely generate and store a private key with a highly reliable tamper-proof module within the IC card.

Since then, no other press releases have been made by Sony CSL. There were no hardware specification sheets or any other evidence that this product ever made it to market. With the significant amount of time that has passed since this was announced, it is prudent to assume that Sony CSL is no longer intent on pursuing this further.
