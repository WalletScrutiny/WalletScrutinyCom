## Analysis 

- We registered and found a legacy BTC wallet address.
- They also have 'mining', 'swap' and 'market' features.
- None of the settings include the backup of private keys. 
- No mnemonic phrase was provided during app initialization.
- The terms were only accessible via the app. Even then, it only leads to an offline page at termsofservice.cos-in.com. 
- The site and the app do not mention 'private keys', 'mnemonics', 'custody' or 'cold-storage', which makes analyzing the app a bit harder. 
- From our experience though, though most of these security terms were not discussed, the lack of mnemonic phrases or options to back up the private keys is enough to tell us that the provider holds them. Thus, making this app **custodial**.
