**Update**: As the app is not available on Google Play, we assume it is defunct
now.

Their description claims:

> Guarantee your exclusive control over seed words or private key of the wallet.

which probably means non-custodial.

But we see no word about its source code.

On their website we find a [link to GitHub](https://github.com/BitApp) but nothing
about Android there, so we assume it is closed-source.

Verdict: This app is **not verifiable**.
