## App

### Wallet Mode On

Turning ON wallet mode means every coin sent to your address will be stored in your wallet and not sold automatically until you decide to sell it. 

Oddly, there seems to be no receive function on the wallet. The send function only allows transfers to other users of Jackocoin.

## Verdict

Like most wallets we've thus tested whose base is in Nigeria, the app has some missing functionalities although they mostly claim Bitcoin as being present or being tradeable on their platform. The wording on this app's [terms of use](https://www.jackocoins.com/termsofuse) implies the existence of a bitcoin wallet albeit with very limited use. But with that said, apps that **cannot send or receive** bitcoins are also custodial.
