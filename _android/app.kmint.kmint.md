The app is compatible with MetaMask

## Analysis 

While the seed phrases were generated upon app initialization, we were not able to add and find 
Bitcoin (BTC) as one of the supported coins. There is a preponderence of "btc" but as tokenized versions 
on other chains namely: 

- Binance Chain 
- Polygon Chain 
- Klaytn Chain 
- Ethereum Chain 

This app does not support BTC.
