**Update 2021-06-11**: This app is not on the Play Store anymore.

This app does not look like a wallet and its code does not look like having
wallet functionality neither. It might side-load some actual functionality at
some point via the used Flutter Webview but given it has almost only 5* fake
reviews and the welcome screen only asks "enter indroduction or restore here"
without allowing the user to create a wallet, we have to assume there is
something very shady going on and **recommend to not use this app.**
