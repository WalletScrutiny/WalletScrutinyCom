## App Description from Google Play

  > Get a simple, elegant, and secure way to trade bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies without blockchain fees.
  >
  > We allow you to trade cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, (BTC), Ether (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin, Dash, Solana, Chainlink (LINK) and others.
  > 
  > CONTRACTS-IN, WALLETS- OUT
  >
  > Crypto wallets are problematic; long access codes, unique protocols and malicious hackers can seriously damage your actions and investments.
  >
  > Crypto contracts remove these difficulties and give you rapid access to whatâ€™s important- the price changes and volatility of the crypto market.

## Analysis 

- This app facilitates the buying and selling of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, without actually using wallets as it explicitly describes. This is a CFD cryptocurrency trading platform which means that it **does not allow users to send or receive bitcoin.**
