## Analysis 

When we looked at the BoA pictures in Google Play, it [clearly indicates](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/rossesvU5rE5OVDbmppHb91ILeZfrF4zbG8stUr8u8HLNOIqP5VNP-4Y7fDzpa4JVvA=w1632-h954-rw) in the interface that a user must provide his or her own bitcoin wallet address when purchasing bitcoin. This app therefore, **does not have a bitcoin wallet**.
