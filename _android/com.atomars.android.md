## Analysis 

- The website has recently been showing [strange behavior](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1656599818180112387) with the logo of Atomars just circling around and around. 
- The same behavior appears on the app.
- The last time this app was updated was in 2019. 
- As a cryptocurrency exchange with cold storage, this app is **custodial**. 
- It is possible that this app and the service is already **defunct**, we [tweeted](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1656600794786041857) them to know about the status of the app.
