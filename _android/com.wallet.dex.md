## Analysis

- The seed phrases were provided during wallet creation.
- Strangely their "multicoin wallet" seems to output nothing when we try to add a receiving wallet to the "Search Asset - Receive" bar.
- We [tweeted](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1673988501711323139) them about this.
- There are also updates on their twitter about certain bugs that stop balances from appearing.
- This tweet was dated [March 13, 2023](https://twitter.com/Dexwallets/status/1635171692585828353):

> okay.. we found the bug of balance loading problem. Just remove our testnet token "DexWallet Test" from the wallet page... it should work smoothly....

- We could not find this testnet token "DexWallet Test" they are referring to.
- Their latest tweet during review, indicates that they will have upcoming announcements. This was dated April 15, 2023.
- We also tried to choose "Add Custom Token", but the screen is blank and there is an error:

> Failed to connect with server.

- Until these issues are addressed, we'll be leaving this as a work-in-progress.
