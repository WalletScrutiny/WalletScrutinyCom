       Can't send Bitcoin out of wallet? App keeps crashing when I try to do so

## Termination Clause 

Section 8 of its Terms and Conditions state that:

> Moreover4u2 may terminate these Terms or suspend Your access to the Services at any time, including, without limitation, in the event of Your alleged or actual misuse of the Services or breach of these Terms.

## App

We downloaded the app and registered. We were then given the choices to "Create a Wallet" or "Import". Choosing "Create a Wallet" displays a 12-word seed phrase. 

We were able to import the wallet using the mnemonics.

Note: When installed on an Android Emulator, its tab name is 'PumaPay' which is the name of another wallet:

{% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.pumapay.pumawallet' %}

This could hint at the app being a copy of a competitor's product, which would at best be a licensed copy and at worst a fake wallet by hackers too lazy to code their own product.

## Verdict

DokWallet **does not refer to the project as an open-source project** in its website or in any of its documentation. We also [could not find any relevant or related code](https://github.com/search?p=1&q=com.dok.wallet&type=Code) with the appID 'com.dok.wallet' on Github.
