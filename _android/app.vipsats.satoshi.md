## Analysis

- [Video](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1699384596528570487)
- We tried registering but keep receiving an error when we enter the email verification code:
  > No connection
- We tried several times and feel that the app is broken.
- The last update for the app prior to our review is about 2 weeks, so this could be a **work-in-progress**.
