The same developer developed similar apps:

- {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.trendo.android' verdict='true' %}
- {% include walletLink.html wallet='iphone/ios.m3.Trendo' verdict='true' %} 

Their websites are the same, and this app does not seem to have an iOS counterpart with the same branding and logo.

## Analysis

- Our account information from {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.trendo.android' %} was carried over to this new app. 
- There is a legacy bitcoin wallet address. Deposit and withdrawal using Bitcoin is possible. 
- The private keys were not provided during app initialization, and we cannot find any option to back up the private keys.
- This is a **custodial** app.
