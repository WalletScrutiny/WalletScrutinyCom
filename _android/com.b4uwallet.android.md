This app is not well advertised on how the users private keys are managed.
At best this is a custodial wallet, we also note there are alot of 1 star reviews on the [android play store page](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.b4uwallet.android&showAllReviews=true).

Our verdict: This "wallet" is custodial and therefore **not verifiable**.
