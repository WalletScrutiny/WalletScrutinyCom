## Analysis

- The first screen gave the following options: 'Create wallet' or 'I already have a wallet'.
- After selecting 'Create wallet', we signed up using our Google account.
- We then set up 2FA via authenticator app. Next, the app asked us to setup a backup password.
- We were then presented with the main interface. We tapped 'Already own crypto?'. The 'Deposit Crypto' screen appeared with a QR code and a public address that begins with 'Ox'.
- The list of supported coins only supported Polygon tokens. WBTC is the closest to Bitcoin.
- It is also possible to buy Coins via Coinbase Pay, Instant Bank Transfer, Debit or Credit Card, Google Pay or Bank Account.
- WBTC is tokenized "bitcoin" on the Polygon blockchain, and is therefore not real bitcoin.
- There is **no Bitcoin support** for this app.
