## Analysis 

It does look a lot like Binance. The founders claim to be former Binance employees. As an exchange they provide multiple coin wallets secured by an account and a password. We were not able to find any options that allow the user to download or restore the private keys. This is a custodial exchange and thus, **not-verifiable.**
