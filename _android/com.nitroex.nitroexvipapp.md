⚠️ **Caution:** Some users have described this app as a scam.

## App Description

The trading bot claims to work with cryptocurrency exchange NitroEx along with other cryptocurrency exchanges.

### Google Play Critical Reviews

We've included this review in order to give the user a warning - however unsubstantiated or elaborated on. After all, cryptocurrency trading bots, can trade user accounts' funds.

  ★☆☆☆☆ January 16, 2021<br>
       Scam Alert!! Do not put money in this.

## The Site

NitroBot Google Play app's listed website points to a cryptocurrency exchange called NitroEx. We assume that the bot was designed to be used for this exchange and others as it claims.

There is a [Technical Paper for the bot (PDF)](https://www.nitroex.io/assets/img/nitrobot_tech_paper.pdf) 
       
## The App

We downloaded and installed the app. However the SMS OTP didn't arrive. Therefore we were not able to test out the bot's features.

## Verdict

Judging from its description and name, this is **not a bitcoin wallet** at all, but a cryptocurrency trading bot.
