## App Description from Google Play 

The app description seems to read more like a corporate prospectus rather than an app description. 

## Analysis 

- The website associated with the app is no longer online. 
- The last working archive [entry](https://web.archive.org/web/20200701000000*/https://oxi-corp.com/) was made in 2020. 
- The app just displays a blank screen in BlueStacks 5 Android 9
- The same results in Android 7 
- These factors lead us to conclude that this app as **defunct**
