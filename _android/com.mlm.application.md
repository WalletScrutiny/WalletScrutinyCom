## Analysis 

- We installed the app and registered.
- Seed phrases were not provided 
- Deposit is only enabled once KYC has been fulfilled. 
- Withdrawal is denominated in INR with a fee of 10 INR 
  - User is asked to fill the following forms:
    - Amount to be withdrawn (In INR)
    - Bank Name 
    - Email address 
    - Account number 
    - IFSC Code
- We were not able to find a BTC wallet that can send/receive. 
- If a BTC wallet is provided after KYC, it is very likely to be a **custodial** offering since there the user has to *request* the provider to allow him to withdraw. 
- To be sure, we'll email them at *peer2btcofficial@gmail.com* to verify
- For now, we'll keep this review as a **work-in-progress**.
