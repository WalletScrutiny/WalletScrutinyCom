With Cryptomat you can not only exchange cryptocurrencies, but also use the referral program to earn money. Invite your friends and get an extra profit from their operations.

## Analysis

- Section 6.1 of the [terms](https://cryptoplat.io/terms-of-service) specifically state that the app does not provide storage services and is mostly an exchange service. 
- The app just displays the logo during startup. We tested on Bluestacks 5 Android 9 and on Android Studio API 27.
- The secondary homepage listed in the Developer Contact, cryptoplat.io is still operational. 
- We emailed the provider via their developer contact: ukccoin2244@gmail.com
- As the app describes, this is mainly an exchange service with **no attached wallet function.** 
- Since the last update for this app was in 2020, we'll mark this app as **defunct** until the provider responds.
