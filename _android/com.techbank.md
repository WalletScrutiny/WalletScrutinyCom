## Analysis 

- This app requires the use of an account tied to our mobile number. It appears that our account information is the same since signing up indicated that we already had an account. We previously reviewed: 

- {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.techbank_dwallet' verdict='true' %}

- We have the same login information for two different apps with the same name but a different Google Play application ID.
- Whenever we log in, the app just closes after inputting our credentials. 
- This is quite concerning as this app may just have gotten our credential. There was no officially linked twitter account so we emailed: support (@) techbank.finance. 
- While we determine the legitimacy of this app, we'll keep this as a **work-in-progress**.
