## Analysis 

The app requires a Nigerian phone number. The Play Store description describes an ability to buy and sell cryptocurrency via the app. 

We were able to secure a temporary Nigerian phone number to sign in. We were able to install the app, but was [unable to locate any option](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1623260362387902465) for accessing any bitcoin or cryptocurrency wallet. 

We asked them on [twitter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1623262078575456257) about it, pending their reply, we'll temporarily mark this app as having **no wallet**. 

We also queried their website for the text "bitcoin" and "cryptocurrency" but could find no results.
