## Analysis 

We downloaded and installed the app, but failed to register because we did not receive a confirmation code. 

According to the site description:

- The app can send and receive Bitcoin.
- Mnemonic phrase is provided 

However, the app does not make any claims that its source is publicly available. We also were not able to find the app's ID on GitHub. Since the app's **source is not publicly available**, it **cannot be verified**.
