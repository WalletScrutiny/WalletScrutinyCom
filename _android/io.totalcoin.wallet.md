On the wallet's description we read:

> Your Bitcoin, Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash are securely hidden in your blockchain
wallet and always under your control.

which is the most "explicit" hint at the wallet being non-custodial.

On their website we find not much about the wallet apart from a link to Google
Play.

On GitHub we
[find no hits searching for their application ID](https://github.com/search?q="io.totalcoin.wallet").

Our verdict: This wallet is **not verifiable**.
