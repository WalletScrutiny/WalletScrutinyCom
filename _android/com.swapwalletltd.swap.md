**Update:** We can't find the app on Google Play anymore and assume it stopped
to exist. With 50k downloads there might be many users wondering how to recover
their coins. Please let us know if you know more!

## Old review

We can find no information on security. Also their links to Knowledge Base and
FAQ are broken. Like this we have to assume it's a custodial wallet and thus
**not verifiable**.
