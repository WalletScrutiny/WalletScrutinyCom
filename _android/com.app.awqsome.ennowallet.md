This app is a crypto wallet which allows users to "store, manage, swap, stake, buy, sell digital assets." In the final paragraph of the app's description, it claims to be a non-custodial wallet.

> Enno Wallet is a non-custodial blockchain wallet. We always respect your privacy. We never have access to your digital assets. You own the private keys. Users remain in sole control of their assets. Funds do not leave their wallets and cannot be frozen.

Ennowallet's [Terms of Use](https://ennowallet.com/terms-of-use/) states that users are provided with a 15-word seed phrase to backup and restore their wallets.

> Enno Wallet is an application that allows You to create and manage a wallet which is derived from a “Backup Phrase” (consists of 15 words) generated and stored locally (not on our servers) through Enno Wallet. You must safeguard Your Backup Phrase (including making offline backup copies) as it is used to derive your private key that controls the “digital assets” (e.g. Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, etc.) that You may use with Enno Wallet.

## Reproducibility

Looking through the associated GitHub account, we were not able to find a relevant repository. We searched for the app ID on GitHub in case there was something we had missed, but it yielded no results. 

We conclude that this app is **not verifiable.**
