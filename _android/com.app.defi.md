## Analysis 

We were able to download and install the app. We were given a wallet with multiple
coin support. Seed phrases were provided.

A BTC wallet with the ability to deposit and withdraw is available. 

There were no indications that the project is Open Source, but they did have an 
organizational page with [several repositories.](https://github.com/LATOKEN). 

The **repository/organization did not have an entry** for their Android app, nor did any significant result come from searching "com.app.defi" on GitHub. 

We emailed them to verify. Tentatively, we'll mark this as with no publicly available source for the Android app.

Though they did note that some parts of their code were [audited by HashEx.](https://github.com/HashEx/public_audits/blob/master/lachain/Lachain-consensus-audit-report.pdf)
