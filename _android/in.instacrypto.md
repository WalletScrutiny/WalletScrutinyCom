## App Description from Google Play

> Unlike other platforms, InstaCrypto requires its users to hold, transact and experience crypto through a wallet of their choice thereby keeping financial power with users themselves.
>
> InstaCrypto takes a step further by delivering crypto, directly to personal wallets, enabling users to be in control of their own crypto at all times.
>
> Transactions take place directly from/to users' personal wallets or bank accounts thereby eliminating the need to store any user information (crypto/financial) on the Instacrypto platform. This ensures the safety of the users crypto/fiat funds.

## Analysis

- When users choose the "buy" option in the app, the user must enter a BTC address in the field.
- This app **does not provide its own bitcoin wallet.**
