  - libapp.so
  - libboltz_dart.so
  - libllwk_dart.so
  - libpayjoin_flutter.so
```

The **.so** files listed are shared object libraries commonly used in Android applications. 

- **libapp.so:** This is likely a core library for the application, containing essential native code used by the app.
- **libboltz_dart.so:** This library is probably related to the Boltz service, which is used for atomic swaps and other cryptocurrency-related operations. The dart suffix indicates it is used with Dart, the programming language behind Flutter.
- **libllwk_dart.so:** This library might be related to a specific functionality or service within the app, with llwk being an acronym or shorthand for that service. The dart suffix again indicates usage with Dart.
- **libpayjoin_flutter.so:** This library is likely related to the PayJoin protocol, a privacy-enhancing Bitcoin transaction method. The flutter suffix indicates it is used within a Flutter application.
