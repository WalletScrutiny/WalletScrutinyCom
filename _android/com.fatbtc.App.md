## The App
We tried the app. It is an exchange app, so you are required to register an account. It is possible to send and receive bitcoin via a QR code or btc address once you set a fund password. We were not provided with an option to backup our wallets.

## Verdict
Due to the information we have collected thus far, our verdict for this app is **custodial.** As such, it is **not verifiable.**
