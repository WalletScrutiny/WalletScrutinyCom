## Analysis

- The site and the app are primarily in Persian.
- We were not able to register.
- According to the [FAQ](https://tabdeal.org/help/faq/), users are given dedicated addresses where they can deposit, send and withdraw. This includes a wallet to withdraw fiat to banks.
- According to the site's [rules and regulations](https://tabdeal.org/termsconditions), any breach by the user of the rules, will give the site the power to temporarily or permanently prevent the user from using the site.
  - Section 11 shows that the platform can block the user from withdrawing from his wallet.
- Here are further portions of the site to give us an impression that the site provides a wallet hosting service:
    - [Buy Cryptocurrency](https://tabdeal.org/buy-cryptocurrency) - Clicking on this brings us to a page with a wallet icon on the top right of the  panel. The page shows a graph similar to Tradeview's plus an order form. The graph shows a trading pair, "BTC/IRT". The buttons for "Buy/Sell" are instead labeled "Login/Register". Clicking on the wallet icon shows a login page.
- At this point, without the ability to register and login, and with difficulty in translation, we assume that this is a custodial platform based on its rules, its interface and its requirement to login to buy cryptocurrencies. If this were a service like ShapeShift, where the user has to input a BTC address generated from the user's own wallet, they would not ask the user to login and instead ask to confirm the buy order.  
- But to be sure, we tried confirming with them on [twitter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1677486524625985538) and on their email info@tabdeal.org if they provide a Bitcoin wallet for their users.
- We will tentatively mark this as **custodial** until they corroborate our findings.
