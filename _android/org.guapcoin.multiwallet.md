## Analysis 

- We signed up with the service using our email address. 
- A bitcoin wallet is present. It's in P2SH format.
- The mnemonics were not presented during initialization. 
- There is an option to back up the private keys of both Guapcoin and Bitcoin. There is a caveat, the format is not standard and possibly not valid. It is presented in a 35-character string that as far as we know, isn't in any of the standard Bitcoin private key formats.

- Nevertheless, assuming that the app is indeed self-custodial, they do have a link to a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/guapcrypto/Guapcoin/releases). Unfortunately, none of the files here seem to point to the source code of the APK file. 

For this reason, this app is **not source-available**.
