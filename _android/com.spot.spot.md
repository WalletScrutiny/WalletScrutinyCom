## Update 2024-07-13

On their website reads:

> Spot will shut down definitely on April 30, 2024

Apart from that, the app has not made its source code available. Users are permanently stopped upon opening the app and may no longer create a new wallet or backup.

## Review 2020-11-16

On their website we read:

> **You control your Bitcoins.**
> 
> PayPal, Coinbase & Binance control your funds. We don't. You have entire
  control over your Bitcoins. We use the best technologies to ensure that your
  funds are always safe.

but as we cannot find any source code to check this claim, the wallet gets the
verdict **not verifiable**.
