## Analysis 

- The app description describes the use of cold wallets for the cryptocurrency exchange. This is a **custodial** provider.
- This is made more evident with this [announcement:](https://bkex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19022106904729-BKEX-Announcement-on-Suspension-of-Withdrawals) 

> Recently, the platform users' funds were involved in 'money laundering' and BKEX is currently cooperating with the police to collect evidence, for which we will suspend withdrawals to cooperate with the work.
>
> BKEX team will fully cooperate with the regulatory investigation and do its best to restore the normal operation of the exchange.
