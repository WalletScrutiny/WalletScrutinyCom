## App Description from Google Play 

> The application for mobile devices Ex-money, a modern and advanced service for converting cryptocurrencies, will allow you to quickly and easily buy or sell Bitcoin (Bitcoin) or any other cryptocurrency presented in the service.

## Analysis 

- We installed the app, there was no registration required. 
- The app opened a lite version of the website. 
- The user gets to input a selected currency or source of funds, and the desired cryptocurrency or fund to exchange with. The app automatically calculates the equivalent value.
- The user then inputs the desired exchange wallet address, his email address or a coupon code, if applicable.
- The user then taps the button to 'Create a Request', by which we assume, they will provide the source address that the user will have to send to exchange. 
- The transaction details are mailed to the user. Once the inputted amount has been sent, the exchanged amount and cryptocurrency is sent to the recipient address.
- The app **does not provide** a wallet for the user.
