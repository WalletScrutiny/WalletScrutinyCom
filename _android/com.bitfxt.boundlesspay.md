## Analysis 

We immediately contacted their support via [chat.](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1641010127909322753)

Where we were immediately informed that it was a custodial service. 

To back this up: 

From their [FAQ:](https://www.boundlesspay.com/faq) 

> How do I withdraw my funds from the Boundlesspay app? 
> 
> Withdrawals from the Boundlesspay app are by two processes. 
>
> A. Withdrawing via cryptocurrencies on the boundless app you can use the email and phone number feature (which is free from transaction charges) to fellow Boundlesspay users. Or you send to other blockchain services by wallet addresses (standard charges are needed set by the Blockchain service provider).

As the provider itself mentioned, this is a custodial service.
