## Analysis 

- After registration, we found a wallet as well as an option to exchange. 
- Bitcoin is supported, and it has both deposit and withdrawal functions. 
- We could not find any option to backup the private keys. 
- There are also 'staking' and 'mining' options.
- There is also an option to Apply or Activate a card [(More info on card)](https://bitfree.us/faq)
- The absence of any option to backup the private keys means that this is a **custodial** app which ties the wallet to a user account.
