       MINUS ZERO Fraudulent Company. Run away quick. Lost $2,000 and no one cares!!!!! This is a scam. Protect your investments.

## Analysis 

- The website is no longer online
- The last working archive of the page was in 2022
- We downloaded the app and it merely opened a browser to the webpage which just shows a 404 error. [(Screenshot)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1664836170256117760)
- If the allegations online are correct, then this app is rightfully **defunct**
