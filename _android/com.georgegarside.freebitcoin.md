       The captcha will not go through. It will not turn on faucet.

       Even after supposed fix, I cannot sign up. Every time I enter the capcha it errors incorrect login details.

## The Site

> **Provably fair randomness**
Uses a ‘provably fair’ random number generator to award bitcoin randomly. You can verify your rolls using the independent roll replay code which you can run locally on your own computer. Every roll has a minimum win which changes daily — you’re guaranteed to win bitcoin with each faucet roll adding to your freebitcoin balance!

> **Automatic withdraw**
Withdraw bitcoin to your desired bitcoin address, with Auto-Withdraw every Sunday (≥0.0001 BTC) or on-demand (v3.0). You don’t need to run the app for the bitcoin to be withdrawn by the server and paid into your account.

## The App

After downloading the app, we ran into the same problems as the reviews noted above. Solving the captcha does not seem to generate any feedback. Moreover, the ios version of the app is no longer available "after an update". 

It is difficult to ascertain whether "real bitcoins" are being sent to a "real bitcoin wallet". The app merely displays numbers prefixed with the Bitcoin sign. It may be feasible for the developer to show this as a representation of "winnings" in the faucet. 

Moreover, the site listed on the Google Play page is the personal website of the developer.

Finally, it would seem that the app is no longer functioning as intended. 

### Registration

After registration, the site freebitco.in, briefly flashed on the screen.

It then brought us to the main dashboard, where we had to finish an hCaptcha. 

Clicking on payouts allows us to change or generate a new Bitcoin address. However, this address was only displayed with no other option but to enable Auto-Withdraw. Options to send or receive are not present. 

## Contact

We contacted the developer George Garside via [twitter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1448594984995680258) for more details on his app.

## Verdict


Due to there being no visible feature that allows users to **deposit money into this app,** we assume that **you can't deposit BTC** and money can't be held in this app. For now, it is more prudent to say that this app **does not function as a wallet.**
