**Note:** There was no website listed on its Google Play page. We also were not able to find its officially linked social media accounts.

## App Description

Sigma Wallet claims to be non-custodial.

> Sigma Wallet is the #1 non-custodial, multi-chain wallet and DeFi gateway, designed to seamlessly connect users to the crypto world in a safe and secure manner.

This is what it says about private keys.

> Private keys that control cryptocurrency stored in secure storage mechanisms provide by OS

They don't have a listed website and their support email [domain](https://sigmanetwork.io) is parked.

## The App

We tried the app. It does not require registration. Creating a wallet provides a mnemonic. You can choose between 12 words and 24 words, and you can also include a passphrase.

## Source Code

Searching for the app ID on Github [returned 0 results.](https://github.com/search?q=io.cryptosigma.finance&type=code)

## Verdict

We **could not locate the source code for this app.** Furthermore, the disappearance of their website and lack of social media presence is highly dubious. We advise users to exercise caution. This app is **not verifiable.**
