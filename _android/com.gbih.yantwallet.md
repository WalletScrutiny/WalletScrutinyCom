The app screenshots suggest that this is a non-custodial wallet as it has a "wallet email backup" and "wallet paper key backup and recovery"

YANT Wallet also supports P2P trading and claims to be a P2P wallet.

> Yant Wallet is a Peer-to-Peer wallet that is not in the central server format, and the exchange operates without a centrally managed server.
>
> No membership or separate service is required, all access is made with PW only, and your request is processed anonymously.

Although this wallet may be self-custodial, there is **no source available for review.** Additionally, it has not seen updates since 2019, thus making it obsolete.
