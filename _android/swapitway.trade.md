## Analysis 

- We installed and registered on the app 
- Amongst other features such as a Giftcard section, we found a Bitcoin wallet. 
- The app can generate a Bitcoin wallet that can send and receive. 
- However, the private keys or backup options were not provided. 
- This is a **custodial** provider.
