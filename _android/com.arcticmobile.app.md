## Analysis

- We started with a 4-digit passcode
- We were also given the option to use Biometrics.
- We then agreed with the Privacy Policy and Terms
- We were then asked to backup the 12-word seed phrase.
- There is a BTC legacy wallet address that has the following options:
  - Send
  - Swap
  - Buy
  - Receive
- There are no claims that the app is source-available. There were [0 results](https://github.com/search?q=com.arcticmobile.app&type=code) on GitHub when we did a code search using the app ID.
- This app is **not source-available**.
