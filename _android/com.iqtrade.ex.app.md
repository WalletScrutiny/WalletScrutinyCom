The registration process seems to be broken for this app/website. We tried inputting our mobile number and it kept issuing an error "Incorrect format"
We tried several combinations both on the mobile app and on the website. On both occasions it issued the same error.

## App Description from Google Play

> Provide more than 30 trading asset such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Sol,crude oil, stocks, and Gold with low trading fees and High leverage , and provide comprehensive transaction analysis information and tools

## Analysis 

We tried to look for documentation but it was sparse. We did find however, that it allowed users to [deposit cryptocurrencies](https://www.iq-trading.com/help/detail?id=783906019314245600)

There are strong indications that this is a cryptocurrency exchange that is custodial, but until we manage to register and test it out, we'll mark this as a **work-in-progress**.
