## Analysis 

- The last blog entries and social media [posts](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1661571853758988288) were in 2019
- Registration completion in the mobile app results in an error 

> SocketException: Failed host lookup: 'app.finwhalex.com (OS Error: No address associated with hostname, errno = 7)'

- Registration attempts on the website results in the opening of a new tab of the same page. Signing up seems to have been disabled. 
- We emailed the developer to ask them about the situation of the app, but we do not expect a reply at info@finwhalex.com 
- Based on the factors mentioned above, and the lack of activity and interaction, we deem this app as **defunct.**

**Update:** Mail delivery failed.
