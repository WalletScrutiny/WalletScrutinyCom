## Analysis 

- The website associated with this app is now offline
- We installed the app and tried to register, however it merely showed a no-wifi status icon. 
- The previous meta-verdict is obsolete with the last update in 2020. 
- We mailed them via support@bokucoin.com but our email bounced. 
- With no working app, no website and an email that bounced, we believe this app is now **defunct**
