Also based on [Emauel](https://gitlab.com/e3amn2l)'s
[Analysis](https://gitlab.com/walletscrutiny/walletScrutinyCom/-/issues/172#note_522567637):

In the description we read:

> We support Bitcoin, ...

and

> The code of our crypto wallet is open-source and it is available on GitHub.

but no claim about being self-custodial. Only:

> CCWallet is a cryptocurrency wallet mobile app with the opportunity of
  sending, receiving funds, tracking transactions, as well as
  **exporting & importing private keys**.

which implies it is self-custodial.

[Their website](https://ccwalletapp.com/) uses an ssl certificate that expired
on 12/25/2020. That doesn't look like a well maintained wallet.

Let's see how far we get with building the app from the public source code:

```

$ git clone https://github.com/coincasso/ccwallet
$ cd ccwallet/

There is a total of 22 commits, all from May and June of 2019. None of them is
tagged. As the latest update of the wallet according to Google is 2020-07-29, we
have to consider the possibility that the app went closed source after an
initial open source release.

Now the complete install instructions:

> # CCWallet 
> 
> ### Installation
      sudo npm i rn-nodeify -g
      npm install
      cd ios
      pod install
      cd ../
      react-native run-ios
      react-native run-android

do not look like instructions that would produce an installable app package with
the final `run-android` part. In ReactNative, that step should rather read:
`cd android; gradlew assembleRelease`:

```
$ docker run -it --volume $PWD:/mnt --workdir /mnt --rm beevelop/cordova bash
root@8fc76c4dbdd3:/mnt# npm i rn-nodeify -g
root@8fc76c4dbdd3:/mnt# npm install
root@8fc76c4dbdd3:/mnt# yes | /opt/android/tools/bin/sdkmanager "build-tools;27.0.3"
root@8fc76c4dbdd3:/mnt# cd android
root@8fc76c4dbdd3:/mnt/android# ./gradlew assembleRelease
> Task :app:processReleaseManifest FAILED
/mnt/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml Error:

        Suggestion: use a compatible library with a minSdk of at most 16,
                or increase this project's minSdk version to at least 19,
                or use tools:overrideLibrary="com.rnfs" to force usage (may lead to runtime failures)

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':app:processReleaseManifest'.

BUILD FAILED in 1m 43s

```

so the build failed with the error:

```
> Manifest merger failed : uses-sdk:minSdkVersion 16 cannot be smaller than version 19 declared in library [:react-native-fs] /mnt/node_modules/react-native-fs/android/build/intermediates/manifests/full/release/AndroidManifest.xml as the library might be using APIs not available in 16
```

which looks like some `react-native-fs` library wasn't pinned to an exact version. Reproducible
builds highly depend on versions being pinned better to cryptographic hashes of
the dependency than to a version number but looking where that dependency came
from:

```
root@8fc76c4dbdd3:/mnt# grep react-native-fs package.json
    "react-native-fs": "^2.11.15",
```

the provider would be fine with any version higher than `2.11.15` of that
library. This is highly problematic, not only because the build can't be
reproduced as soon as the library gets any update but also because it makes the
wallet vulnerable to any such library getting an upgrade with a backdoor which
would automatically get compiled into the wallet. Lastly it's also problematic
because the build instructions might change.

In summary, this app is **not verifiable**.
