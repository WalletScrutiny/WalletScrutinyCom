## Analysis

- They self-describe as a 'decentralized cryptocurrency exchange'
- According to their [terms:](https://vynksafe.com/terms)
  - VYNKSAFE maintains full custody of digital assets in the event of fraud, violation of the law or of the terms.
  - They have the right to freeze, suspend and terminate user's access to the account.
  > VYNKSAFE has been committed to maintaining the security of User entrusted funds. 
- The last quoted statement implies that funds are in their custody. Although not explicitly mentioning "cold-storage" or "custodial solutions", we can derive from the statement above that the user will have to entrust their funds with the platform.
- This is a **custodial** provider and the app is **not verifiable**.
