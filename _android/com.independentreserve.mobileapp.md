## App Description from Provider

### [Security](https://www.independentreserve.com/security)

> Independent Reserve is a responsible cryptocurrency exchange with a risk-averse approach to the way we manage our business.
>
> We maintain complete segregation of our customer assets at all times to ensure that if you need your crypto, we’ve got it. We keep your funds safe. That is our promise.
>
> How we treat client assets
>
> - We do not ever lend, trade or reinvest your assets.
- We maintain 1:1 reserves of all client assets and keep the vast majority of these in offline cold storage vaults.
- We maintain segregation of our customers’ holdings.
- Our books are balanced, and there is no debt on our balance sheet.
- We engage external auditors to undertake an annual audit of our financial statements in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards. The audit includes verification of all client asset holdings. Both fiat and crypto.

## Analysis

- There is [BTC support.](https://www.independentreserve.com/blog/knowledge-base/how-to-deposit-bitcoin-into-independent-reserve)
- As the description on the website states, 97% of user funds are held in cold-storage.
- This makes it a **custodial** app.
