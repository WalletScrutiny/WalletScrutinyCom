**Update 2022-01-20**: This app is not available anymore.

This DeFi trading app is described in its Google Play:

> Download this defi crypto app now for FREE and buy Alt Coins, Meme Coins & everything in-between. Invest in cryptocurrency with the exclusive app for new crypto coins - 100xAltbase.

We downloaded the app and proceeded to create a wallet. Creating a wallet was done through a 12 word mnemonic. After that, BNB and 100xcoin were readily available. As its name implies, it is focused on alt coins. We searched for a BTC wallet, and there was none. 

To verify we went on their Telegram support channel and asked. They confirmed this and suggested that it would be a "future feature".

This DeFi app, has **no bitcoin wallet**.
