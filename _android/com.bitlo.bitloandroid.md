## App Description 

This is primarily a Turkish cryptocurrency exchange app. Once the app is installed, the app asks you to register. We were not able to register as it needed a Turkish ID number/Turkish foreigner number. 

> Your digital coins are stored in offline wallets. In our high security system, your investments are always safe.

## Analysis 

As a cryptocurrency exchange that stores coins in cold storage on behalf of customers, this is a **custodial** service.
