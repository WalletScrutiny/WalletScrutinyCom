## Analysis

- We tried the app, but when we tapped on 'Create a New Wallet' it did not do anything. We tried on BlueStacks 5 Android 9 and on an Android device.
- The homepage listed in the developer contact, is offline.
- We [tweeted](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1675070504196079617) them about it, but for now, presume that this app is already **defunct**
