Our inhouse crypto arbitrage team is able to trade risk free to give you your interest. We do not loan out your crypto nor use it for risk endeavours so your crypto assets are safe with us.

## Analysis 

We installed the app and found a Bitcoin wallet. The user has to undergo KYC prior to being able to deposit or withdraw. 

On the homepage it is also stated: 

>  We offer our users protection of your digital assets **stored with us**.

This is a **custodial** service.
