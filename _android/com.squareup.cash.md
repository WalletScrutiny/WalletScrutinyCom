This app is primarily a banking app:

> Cash App is the easiest way to send, spend, save, and invest your money. Itâ€™s
  the SAFE, FAST, and FREE mobile banking app.

but you can also receive and send Bitcoins with it:

> **BUY, SELL, DEPOSIT, AND WITHDRAW BITCOIN**
> 
> Cash App is the easiest way to buy, sell, deposit, and withdraw Bitcoin. Track
  the BTC price in realtime in your app and get started by buying as little as
  $1 of Bitcoin. Your BTC arrives in your app instantly. You can then decide to
  keep it safe in Cash App or withdraw it to a different wallet.

To little surprise for a banking app, we can't find any claims about the Bitcoin
Wallet being non-custodial. As a custodial offering, this app is **not
verifiable**.
