**Update 2021-10-23**: This app is no more.

Apparently this is a BTC wallet:

> Exodus allows you to secure, manage, and exchange your favorite
  cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and more from a beautiful,
  easy to use wallet that puts you in control of your wealth.

There are several other products using the name "Exodus", so this might be a
fake of
{% include walletLink.html wallet='android/exodusmovement.exodus' verdict='true' %}?

No website is provided and the developer uses the email
`contact@exuduxcrypto.com`, which is a weird derivation of the "Exodus" brand.

For the lack of further information we side with caution and give this a
**fake** verdict.
