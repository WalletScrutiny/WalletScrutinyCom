Their description

> Manage your private keys, multiple wallets, and open channels, to get
  connected with peers on the Lightning Network and start transacting today.

sounds non-custodial.

On their website we find [their GitHub repository](https://github.com/LN-Zap/zap-android)
and there a bit hidden, the [build instructions](https://github.com/LN-Zap/zap-android/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md#build-apk-and-install-it-later-on-phone).

So let's try this without Android Studio, as we don't want to automate clicking
buttons in Android Studio ...

For my phone Google Play offers to download version `0.2.11-alpha`.

```
$ cd zap-android/
$ git tag | grep 0.2.11
v0.2.11-alpha
$ git checkout v0.2.11-alpha 
$ docker run --rm -it --volume=$PWD:/mnt --workdir /mnt mreichelt/android:latest bash
root@84c836f4577a:/mnt# ./gradlew bundleRelease
root@84c836f4577a:/mnt# mv app/build/outputs/apk/release/zap-android-0.2.11-alph* .
root@84c836f4577a:/mnt# exit
$ ls *.apk
'zap-android-0.2.11-alpha(17)-arm64-v8a-release-unsigned.apk'  'zap-android-0.2.11-alpha(17)-armeabi-v7a-release-unsigned.apk'
```

So ... this is a problem. The version "Varies with device" as we already noticed
on the Playstore description. App providers can publish a different app for you
than they publish for me, so me verifying a build gives you not much of
information. This is why we are also working on a
[tool to collect APKs](https://gitlab.com/walletscrutiny/walletscrutinyandroid)
that hopefully soon will detect which version you downloaded, check if it was
already verified to match the published code and upload it to us if not.

Should we be able to verify the one APK but naturally not the other, this should
be our top priority to work on.

```
$ apktool d -o fromBuild-arm64-v8a 'zap-android-0.2.11-alpha(17)-arm64-v8a-release-unsigned.apk'
$ apktool d -o fromBuild-armeabi-v7a 'zap-android-0.2.11-alpha(17)-armeabi-v7a-release-unsigned.apk'
$ apktool d -o fromPlay Zap\ 0.2.11-alpha\ \(zapsolutions.zap\).apk 
$ diff --brief --recursive fromPlay/ fromBuild-armeabi-v7a/
Files fromPlay/apktool.yml and fromBuild-armeabi-v7a/apktool.yml differ
Only in fromPlay/lib: arm64-v8a
Only in fromBuild-armeabi-v7a/lib: armeabi-v7a
```

... so my phone installed the `arm64` version but as

contains more than the expected two to three files about the signature, this is
not a clean reproducible build.

Our verdict: **not verifiable**.
