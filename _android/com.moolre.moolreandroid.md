       I used moolre in its early days and it was great 👍, but now they are just thrash. I deposited money into my account and cannot send it anywhere (error says bitcoin network is down, tried all the crypto they provide but failed). I am left with just one option, to withdraw my money back the same way I deposited it and they are charging me so much for the withdrawal. I just made a loss. Wouldn't recommend.

       I love this app, its easy to access but I'm having a pending transaction since 15th April 2020 till date.

## Analysis

- After email verification, we were presented with the dashboard. 
- Under 'My Wallets', the denomination is MLR and GHS. There is an option to 'Add New' then 'Create a Wallet'
- Under 'Create a Wallet', we selected a 'network'. The choices were:
    - Moolre
    - Blockchain
    - Ghana
    - Nigeria
    - United States
    - Uganda
- We selected 'Blockchain' and 'Bitcoin' for the currency. There is a toggle option for 'Activate API'
- A notice appears noting that the provider is not a deposit-taking app and stores 'National Currency Assets' with an appropriately regulated financial institution. They can also delay top-ups if they find the transaction suspicious.
- After verifying the email address and phone number, we were able to create a BTC wallet with a legacy address. 
- Apart from topping up, the only other option is to swap. Swapping entails swapping from BTC to Moolre. 
- Payouts are from Moolre to the following:
    - GhQR
    - Vodafone Cash
    - MTN Mobile Money
    - AirtelTigo Money
    - Bank Transfer
- When selected, payouts from the BTC wallet to another BTC wallet is possible. 
- We did not find any provision to back up the private keys and were not given these during registration.
- For the reasons stated above, we determine this app to be **custodial**.
- It should be noted that several people have complained of not receiving deposited funds on {{ page.title }}'s [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/moolrehq/reviews).
