## App Description from Google Play 

> With Publet Wallet, you can manage Bitcoin, Bitcoin Vault, Ethereum, Orbs, IDA, and IDP

## Analysis 

- The app has an undated announcement concerning unauthorized withdrawals and their mitigation measures. The announcement could be found [here](https://www.publet.io/how-to-use). They also announced that they would be inspecting every withdrawal to see which are legitimate or not. The app would also be undergoing some changes. 
- The Terms and Conditions is also described as the "How to Use" page. 
- It describes that the app makes use of mnemonic keys that are generated. 
- It also states that the user is responsible for the safekeeping of these. 
- We were not able to install the app because of an error during signup: 

> Alert: Error: Network Error

- Assuming that the description in the app and terms are accurate, then this is a self-custodial wallet that has a BTC wallet that can send/receive. 
- We were **not able to find any references to source-availability**.
- Given the last update date, it may also be possible that this app is already **defunct**. 
- We emailed the provider at info@publet.io and also through their contact form at the bottom of the homepage. We'll mark this as **defunct**.
- The email was returned.
