## Analysis

- This is a cryptocurrency exchange. 
- After signing up, the deposit field for BTC, was grayed out. We were asked to provide Level 1 KYC prior to being able to deposit. 
- We were not given the private keys during registration. 
- This makes this provider **custodial** and the app, non-verifiable.
