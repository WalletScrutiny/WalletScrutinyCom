According to the app's description on Play Store it is:

> a Cryptocurrency Wallet that allows you to make fast and secure transactions over the Lightning network, Bitcoin and others.

Based on information from the Terms of Service, Suni Wallet provides the user with private keys and allows for the creation of multiple wallets. There is also a feature to "Carry out cryptocurrency sale and purchase transactions through P2P operations."

At the moment, this app is **not verifiable** as there is no linked source code or GitHub.
