## Analysis 

- Signal Financial is a US-based Credit Union and their app has several online banking features such as checking, savings, loans and credit cards.
- The documentation on how the app is used to "trade bitcoin" was non-existent.
- When we opened the app, it first asked us to verify our identity by providing account specific information such as Signal Financial account number as well as a US SSN. We were not able to register. They also informed us that they match the information we will provide to their records.
- At this point, we would have to contact them via email or [social media](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1696017503422710120) to find out how the app is used to trade Bitcoin.

**Update 2024-01-09**

- With no response from Signal Financial both on twitter and on email, and with no proof that this app has a Bitcoin wallet, we would have to assume that this **has no bitcoin wallet**.
