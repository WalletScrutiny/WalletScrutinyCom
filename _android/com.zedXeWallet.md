⚠️ **Warning**: there are some [allegations](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=printpage;topic=5050117.0) on BitcoinTalk.org

## Analysis 

- We tried registering both on mobile and on the web. 
- On mobile, we receive the following error:

> SyntaxError: JSON Parse error; Unexpected EOF 

- We tweeted them to inquire about the status of the app. 
- Since, we are not able to test the app, we could only go by their description, which shows: 
  - The app supports BTC 
  - The app provides the private keys 
- Although the app, according to the description is self-custodial, it **doesn't identity itself as a source-available project**. The app was last updated 3 years ago, and could very well be **defunct**. Perhaps more telling is a [scam allegation](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=printpage;topic=5050117.0) on bitcointalk.org.
- We'll wait until they reply to our tweet.
