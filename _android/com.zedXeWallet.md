## Analysis

- We tried registering both on mobile and on the web.
- On mobile, we receive the following error:

> SyntaxError: JSON Parse error; Unexpected EOF

- We tweeted them to inquire about the status of the app.
- Since, we are not able to test the app, we could only go by their description, which shows:
  - The app supports BTC
  - The app provides the private keys
- The app describes itself as self-custodial.
- It **doesn't identify itself as a source-available project**.
- There were [0 results](https://github.com/search?q=com.zedXeWallet%2F&type=code) for the app ID on GitHub when we did a code search.
- Furthermore, the app was last updated 3 years ago, and could very well be **defunct**.

- We'll wait until they reply to our tweet.

**Update: 2023-07-03**

They haven't replied.
