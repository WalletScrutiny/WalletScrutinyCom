## App Description from Google Play

> Spark Wallet is a community-driven project focused on the mass adaption of Bitcoin through the Bitcoin Lightning protocol. Spark Wallet allows a safe, secure, and easy-to-use for non-technical users to get started with Bitcoin. Reach out to us if you are experiencing issues or if you have suggestions youâ€™d like to see in the upcoming release.

## Analysis 

- The app was very clear when it states in its description: 
  > Spark Wallet is a **custodial** wallet giving users a stress-free and very convenient way to store funds at a click away; all you have to do is to set up an account and remember a password and leave the security to us.

This *custodial* service provider makes this app **non-verifiable**.
