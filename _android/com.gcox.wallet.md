## Analysis 

- The app's website is no longer online
- Whenever we try to run the app, it would give out an error: 

> It appears your device is jailbroken. 

- To login, we have to select a wallet, when we click the dragdown menu, nothing appears. This happened on both the Bluestacks 5 Android Nougat and Pie versions.
- We also tried on an Android Emulator API 27, and it gave the same error.
- This app is **defunct** with no website, a non-functioning app, and a last known update of more than 2 years ago.
