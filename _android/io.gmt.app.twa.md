## Analysis

- The project has a token called the [GoMiningToken](https://help.token.gomining.com/faq/about-gmt) (GMT). It also features an NFT marketplace.
- Users can sign up using MetaMask, WalletConnect or email.
- It is possible to add a third-party BTC wallet address, but users would have to pass KYC. Additionally, the BTC wallet is NOT generated by the app, but from other wallet apps such as {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.wallet.crypto.trustapp' verdict='true' %}.
- There is a GMT wallet that can be used for staking and NFT purchases.
- This is **not a bitcoin wallet app**.
