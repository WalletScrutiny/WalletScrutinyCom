## App Description

Google Play lists its features: 

> - Buy and sell cryptocurrencies
> - Store, deposit and send crypto
> - Earn yield on Proof-of-Stake assets
> - Convert bitcoin into wrapped bitcoin

Proof that it is custodial:

> We use two-factor authentication (2FA) for every account and most transactions, and we’re backed by **top custodians like BitGo and Gemini Custody** so your funds are safe. Best of all, crypto storage is free. We don’t charge any custody or wallet fees when using the CoinList app.

## Verdict

App is **custodial** and thus **not verifiable**.
