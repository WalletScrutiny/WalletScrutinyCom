       I ordered several times, most of the time they send otp manually & charge 100 for automated exchange. Today ordered $10 Order got cancelled then i received otp.
       
## Analysis 

We registered for the service and downloaded the app. The interface for the web app and the mobile app are basically the same.[(Twitter Screenshot)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1644608515787591681). Very much like ShapeShift.io, the user would input the payment mechanism on one side, and the desired exchanged currency on the other with the equivalent computations. We were not able to find a mode to deposit Bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency. This is **not a wallet**.
