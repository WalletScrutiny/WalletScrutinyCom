## Analysis

- We signed up and put in our email address and phone number.
- This is a cryptocurrency exchange with a multi-currency wallet.
- We selected BTC and was provided with a P2SH BTC address.
- Funds could be transferred to either Spot or Funding wallets.
- There are multiple cryptocurrency pairs, P2P, buy and sell options.
- We opened all tabs to try and find any option to backup the private keys, and did not find any. The web interface only features a login screen.
- Although there is no specific mention of custody or of cold-wallets, the lack of private key backups means the provider is holding the private keys. Therefore, this app is **custodial**.
