## Analysis 

- The app keeps closing but we were able to see most parts of it. 
- The app itself **does not provide its own wallet**. 
- A Poloniex User's API key has to be entered in order to access the user's account.
- Note that this is not an official app. The official app is {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.plunien.poloniex' verdict='true' %}
