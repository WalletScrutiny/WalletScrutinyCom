## Analysis 

The [terms](http://mudra.exchange/terms) specify:

> Mudra Exchange shall have the right but not the obligation to verify such activity by sharing Your IP address and other KYC details with the relevant authority, and if required, suspend the transactions or freeze your access.

Although it is not explicitly stated that the platform uses cold storage, or whether they keep the private keys or not, their ability to *"suspend transactions"* or *"freeze the user's access to his own account"* points to a **custodial** arrangement.
