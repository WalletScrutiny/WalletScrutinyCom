> 2. Open the app and register your personal and Naira bank account details, then your unique Cash-in wallet address will be auto-generated for you.
> 3. Share your Cash-in wallet address with anyone who wants to pay you in Crypto.
> 4. Once you receive Crypto in your Cash-in wallet address, it will be automatically converted into Naira and paid into your registered bank account within minutes.

## Analysis 

- Once the app opens, we are asked to fill in African bank details including:
    - Bank name
    - Account No.
    - Email address
- We provided some test details we found online and it then gave an account name. Registration was completed.
- Cash-in with fiat is possible with their third-party partner, Transak.
- The cash in would be in USDT, and this cannot be withdrawn.
- Other supported payment methods are Apple Pay, Google Pay, Credit/Debit card and bank transfer. 
- The platform charges a fee for this and KYC will be required.
- The app automatically gathered information from our location and presented local non-African banks and payment options.
- The home screen shows Bitcoin, BUSD, USDT and USDC.
- Cash in with Binance Pay and Trust Wallet is also possible. 
- Once we clicked 'bitcoin', we were presented a Bech32 BTC wallet address that we think is controlled by the provider, as no private keys were given. 
- We were notified that once bitcoin is sent to this address, it would be immediately converted to Naira to be withdrawn to the bank account we inputted before. 
- **Bitcoin cannot be sent and received** through this app.
