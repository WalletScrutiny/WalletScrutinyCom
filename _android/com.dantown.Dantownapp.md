## Update 2023-04-22

Dantown replied. Apparently, there is no BRP-20 and it was an error. [(Twitter)](https://twitter.com/godantown/status/1649438834344484864). It was a Bitcoin address that we verified on Blockchair. 

We were not able to access the private keys. Therefore this service is a **custodial** one.

       I just had a bad experience with this app, I sent Bitcoin my Dantown wallet address and nothing show up... I'm very upset with this app, I thought it was ok at first but unfortunately it was not as I thought...

## Analysis 

We downloaded the app and successfully registered. There is a Bitcoin wallet that can send and receive. However, when we took a look at the network - it states that the network must be **BRP-20**. We took a [screenshot](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1649357857589182464/photo/4) to document this. 

We also emailed their support and [tweeted](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1649358675021291526) to find out what the real situation is.  

We can think of two possible verdicts for this app. Once is that the Bitcoin they are processing is not BTC, or, they simply had a typo and this is a custodial service. To be sure, we'll mark this as a work-in-progress pending new information.
