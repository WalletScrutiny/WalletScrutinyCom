       Very stupid app. How can you tell me rate changed after I have initiated a trade and you have redeemed my app. Better stop that rubbish. I'm never trading here till this stops This app is too slow. If you can't build a proper app then trade on whatsapp or Instagram. It's too slow and doesn't even give notification. Please develop a proper app

       This is the worst trading app I've ever used.... always stealing my money not sending my money to me...I've lost thousands of naira while trading with this god-damned app

## The Site

The Terms of Service, Privacy Policy and About Us sections, all point to the homepage.

## The App

Requirements: username, email and password

On the app, the options Security, Transaction History and Help can't be accessed. They merely show a notification that the feature is coming soon. 

Apart from that, there is a Rate calculator that merely converts the value of a gift card to Naira. There are no buttons and other functionalities that point to the app as being able to hold, send or receive bitcoin. 

## Verdict

We've reviewed many similar apps of Nigerian origin that facilitates the trading of various gift cards and this is one of the most incomplete ones. Unless we missed something, this app certainly **does not have a Bitcoin wallet** at its present state.
