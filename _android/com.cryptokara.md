## Update 2024-07-17

The website of the app claims:

> ### Open Sourcel (sic)
>
> 100% open sourced project for improved transparency & further developments by Blockchain & Crypto geeks.

but fails to link to any source code. Neither could we find the app ID ["com.cryptokara" on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=%22com.cryptokara%22+android&type=code) in any relevant Android code.

## Review 2022-06-24

This self-custodial app states that the private keys never leave the device. It also has a Dapp browser and can exchange multiple cryptocurrencies. Once the app is installed the user can either create a wallet or restore from a seed phrase. The seed phrases provided consists of 12 words. 

The listed website does not have a lot of content. However, we were able to find a secondary website related to the app. 

It is possible to export the private keys for individual cryptocurrency wallets. It will then display the keys in plain text. 

We were not able to find any links to a repository.
