**Update 2021-11-11**: This app is not on Play Store anymore.

## App Description

> NinjaCoin is a digital mineable cryptocurrency. Privacy and private transactions are the priority. Guaranteed by the proof of work of the ninja miners, with easy-to-use mobile wallet. Is based on cryptonote blockchain.

NinjaCoin is a BEP20 Binance Token

## Verdict

We tested the app, and it only supports NINJACoin. It does **not have a Bitcoin wallet**.
