## App Description

> Rise Wallet is a simple bitcoin wallet app, optimized for new users. Redeem our Bitcoin Gift Card instantly. Control your funds via the private key. Manage any number of wallets with a single key. Enjoy real time bitcoin price quotes and price history analysis. Use the built-in Bitcoin Marketplace to learn about the ecosystem. Bitcoin ATM locator helps you get quick cash for your coins when needed.

## Terms and Conditions

We read Rise's Terms and found this provision, under Section 4 stating that users cannot:

> **Reverse engineer any aspect of the App, or do anything that might discover source code** or bypass or circumvent measures employed to prevent or limit access to any content, area or code of the App.

## The App

Once you start the app users are given three options: redeem btc, open a new wallet and open existing wallet. Users are then given the private key.

The wallet supports sending and receiving BTC.

## Verdict

There's no information if the source code is available and no Github account either. We assume that the source code is simply not publicly available, thus making this app **not verifiable**.
