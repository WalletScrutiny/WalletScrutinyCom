>AvaTradeGO enables users to trade, monitor their accounts, engage in social trading and follow top traders from all over the globe.

It's a trading platform and most likely custodial.

From [their website:](https://www.avatrade.com/forex/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin)

> As a CFD brokerage firm, we do not provide crypto wallets to store your Bitcoin. We simply provide access to intuitive platforms for you to trade real-time price changes of Bitcoin.

It clearly is not a wallet. Sounds like a no send/receive.
