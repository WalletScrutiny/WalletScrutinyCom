## Analysis 

- We installed the app in 2 environments: 
  - BlueStacks 5 Android Nougat (Android 7)
  - BlueStacks 5 Android Pie (Android 9)
- In both instances, the app displayed an error: 

> Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again later. 

- The website associated with this app seems to feature several other businesses such as GCC Real Estate, GCC Global Bank, and about 30+ more entities. 
- We will email them at info@theglobalcc.com to ask about the status of their app. 
- It is very likely that the app is already **defunct**, but we'll wait until they reply. 
- We will treat it as a **work-in-progress** for the meantime.
