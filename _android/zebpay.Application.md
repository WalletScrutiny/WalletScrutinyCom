In the description at Google Play we read:

> We use industry leading practice of maintaining the majority of customer
  cryptos offline

This app is an interface for an exchange and as such, only a window into what
you have in your account at that exchange. As a custodial wallet or bitcoin
bank it is **not verifiable**.
