## Analysis

- The site is primarily in Russian. We translated using Google translate.
- It is possible to connect MetaMask, Coinbase and WalletConnect to the platform. This is primarily used when swapping or exchanging.
- The personal profile has a field where the user can enter a TRC20 USDT address.
- We were not able to find a means to deposit or withdraw BTC, or any other wallet for that matter, in the account of the user.
- Users can find listings of various cryptocurrency pairs posted by people. They can then choose which one is appropriate for them.
- P2P is also available but the user has to register a separate account.
- Despite the description, we find no evidence that the platform generates a wallet for the user. Even a separate USDT wallet has to be inputted on the platform. This app has **no wallet.**
