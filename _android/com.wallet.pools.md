## Analysis

- The app's listed developer contact website is offline. The only archive entries for the domain listed is in 2001.
- We were provided with the seed phrases during startup. We could also backup the mnemonics in 'Settings'.
- There are 5 options in the bottom tab menu:
  - Wallet
  - Market
  - Mining
  - News
  - Setting
- We can add tokens and NFTs.
- The only networks available are: BSC, Ethereum, Polygon, Pools, Pools Testnet, Fantom, Avalanche, Cronos and Arbitrum. We did not find Bitcoin in the list.
- The closest to what the description says when it mentioned "Bitcoin" is BTCB, renBTC and BTCST.
- This app **does not support Bitcoin**.
