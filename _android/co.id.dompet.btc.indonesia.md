This app looks like a terminal for a website:

> Dompet Bitcoin Indonesia is a bitcoin wallet that is fully integrated with
  Indodax.com. You can now easily access every feature that is available in
  Indodax.com website through your smartphones only with a few clicks of your
  fingers.

So while this app claims that indodax.com is their website, that website does
not (anymore) link to this Play Store app but to
{% include walletLink.html wallet='android/id.co.bitcoin' %}. As both are provided by the same developer,
this looks like a predecessor-successor-thing.

As indodax.com is an exchange, we assume that like in many such cases the
app is a custodial offering and thus **not verifiable**.
