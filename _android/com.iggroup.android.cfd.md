> Discover the state-of-the-art CFD and forex trading app from the world’s No.1 CFD provider.**
Trade over 17,000 financial markets with ease, wherever you are – including forex, shares, indices and commodities.

[Deposits](https://www.ig.com/en/help-and-support/deposits-and-withdrawals/deposits/how-do-i-deposit-funds-into-my-account) are done via traditional means, including credit card and bank transfer.

Given the fact this app advertises itself as a *CFD trading platform*, we can conclude that it is not a bitcoin wallet and you **can't send or receive.**
