This service is a digital asset exchange that originates from India. KYC is required in order to deposit and withdraw. KYC procedures require Indian residents' PAN (Permanent Account Number). 

Section 5.6 from the [Terms and Conditions](https://crosstower.com/terms-of-use-privacy/) reads:

> CrossTower securely stores all Digital Asset private keys in our control in a combination of online and offline storage. As a result, it may be necessary for CrossTower to retrieve certain information from offline storage in order to facilitate a Digital Asset Transaction in accordance with your instructions, which may delay the initiation or crediting of such Digital Asset Transaction for a period of time, which period of time may be significant. You acknowledge and agree that a Digital Asset Transaction facilitated by CrossTower may be delayed for this reason.

The provider retains control of the private keys and is thus a **custodial** service.
