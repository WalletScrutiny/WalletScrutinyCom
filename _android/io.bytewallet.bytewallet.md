## Update 2024-07-22

[Description from the website:](https://www.bytefederal.com/)

>  Send & receive Bitcoin, find any ATM and login instantly.
>
>    Worldâ€™s fastest growing non-custodial crypto wallet
>    Buy, sell & trade crypto under one platform
>    Swap cryptocurrencies instantly

It claims to be non-custodial, which means that the private keys would be under control of the user. As for the topic of reproducibility, we found an associated [GitHub profile.](https://github.com/bytefederal/) but no source code for the wallet. This app remains **not verifiable.**

## Old Review 2023-05-05

> Store, send, and receive Bitcoin safely and easily. Manage your ByteFederal account and find our nearest Bitcoin ATM locations.

- We installed the app and was able to create a Bitcoin wallet.
- The wallet can send/receive.
- The app provided the backup phrase.
- There are no claims the app is Open Source.
- We were not able to find the corresponding app ID on GitHub.
- This app's source is **not publicly available.**
