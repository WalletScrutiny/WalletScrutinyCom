## Analysis

- We were provided the seed-phrases during wallet creation.
- Similar to most DeFi wallets, the BTC supported in this app is a tokenized version of Bitcoin such as wBTC.
- The only [available networks](https://help.slingshot.finance/en/articles/6417970-which-networks-are-supported-by-slingshot) for this app are:
  - Arbitrum One
  - BNB Chain
  - Canto
  - Ethereum
  - Polygon
  - Optimism
- Despite the description, this app **does not support the BTC network/blockchain**, but instead uses tokenized versions of it in the aforementioned networks.
