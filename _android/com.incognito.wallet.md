After many many reviews of custodial wallets, this one makes a promising claim:

> Don’t leave yourself exposed. Go Incognito. It’s non-custodial, decentralized,
  and completely open-source.

And indeed there is [a repository](https://github.com/incognitochain/incognito-wallet)
with 3647 commits by 16 contributors with recent commits. That looks solid!

Unfortunately the project appears to not share the needed `.env` file for
reproducible builds or otherwise build instructions for that purpose.

We reached out to them in
[this issue](https://github.com/incognitochain/incognito-wallet/issues/1422)
and hope to get feedback, soon but for now the app is **not verifiable**.
