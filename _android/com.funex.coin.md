## App Description from Google Play 

> Funex is one of the best Multi-crypto wallets which allows its users to access top-notch features. It is well-known to carry out the safest, most secure, and quick digital transactions. The Funex is being distributed at a mega-scale supply across the following networks: Tron, Binance, Ethereum, & Polygon Smart Chain.

## Analysis 

- The [whitepaper](https://funexcoin.com/asset/img/funex-whitepaper.pdf) shares some information about seed phrases: 

> Note: The Seed Phrase is of crucial importance. It is used to sign in or recover your account. The Seed Phrase should be kept with the utmost safety. If it is lost, there is no other way to recover your account.

- Despite claims that it only supported Tron, Binance, Ethereum and Polygon, there was a BTC wallet that can send/receive. 
- Despite claims in the whitepaper that the app provides the seed phrase, we were not able to find it. We will try again.
- We did however, register our email addresses and passwords.
- We sent a ticket to their support via the app to ask where the seed phrases can be found.
- We also [tweeted](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1661601267490205698) them.
- We'll keep this as a **work-in-progress** until they respond.
