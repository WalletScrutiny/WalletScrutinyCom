## Analysis

- Section 4 of the [Global Terms](https://fasset.io/user-agreement-global/), details Fassets inability to provide access to the platform in the event when the user is not able to comply with KYC and ID-verification protocols.
- Section 2.1 of the [User Agreement](https://fasset.io/user-agreement/) describes the user's eligibility to use the **custodial** services of the platform.
- Section 4.2 of the same User Agreement, specifically allows the user to appoint Fasset to be the custodian of any digital asset.
- Based on these facts, we give this app a verdict of **custodial**.
