## Service Documentation

The app can receive payments from customers. It should be noted that netcents has two account types: personal and business

We were able to access some functionalities with limitations since we did not submit ID verification.

There is a bitcoin wallet ([screenshot](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1455477233171062787)). When you mouseover the following options are revealed:

- deposit
- withdrawal
- transfer

Before any of those options can be unlocked the user has to verify his identity.

[Withdrawing to another wallet](https://support.net-cents.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000219107-Withdrawing-Cryptocurrencies-to-an-External-User) is possible.

## Verdict

This app is a full-featured payment solution that contains a bitcoin wallet. It is however, highly controlled by NetCents as exhibited in their [Terms](https://net-cents.com/terms).

The service is **custodial**, which means that the **app cannot be verified**.
