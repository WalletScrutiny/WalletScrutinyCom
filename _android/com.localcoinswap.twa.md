## Analysis 

- There is a BTC address. 
- Backing up the private key is possible via the settings.
- We were not able to find claims that the app is source-available.
- There were [no results](https://github.com/search?q=com.localcoinswap.twa&type=code) when searching GitHub Code for the app ID.

Although we eventually found a GitHub [organization](https://github.com/orgs/LocalCoinSwap/repositories) matching the url of the app's homepage, we could not find a repository for the Android app. This app is **not source-available**.
