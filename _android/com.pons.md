<p>⚠️ Warning: This app is very similar to:</p>

**UPDATE 2021-11-22:** As there has been no reply to [our tweet](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1453291043055710208) for almost one month, we will classify this app as **defunct.**


## App Description

The Google Play description was also copied from [Crypterium's Google Play page](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crypterium) including the emojis. They even copied the name "Crypterium" in its description. An example:

> Crypterium is integrated with the Top 10 cryptocurrency trading platforms. Convert Bitcoin to other crypto or fiat and vice versa. Our bid-matching system makes sure you always get the best rate.

- DAO Bank's developer, the [PONS Group](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=PONS+GROUP) claims that it's related to Crypterium. We believe that the CEO of the Pons Group is a certain [Oleg Orlov - (Facebook post)](https://m.facebook.com/DAO.Consensus/photos/a.161082725558712/198817421785242/?type=3&_rdr).

- DAO Wallet's developer, the [DAO Consensus](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=DAO+Consensus) did not claim to have any relation to Crypterium. We believe the CEO of DAO Consensus to be [Ilia Churakov](https://december.daoconsensus.com/team/ilia-churakov)

## The App

We were not able to install the app due to an error: "Your connection is not secure. Connect to a secure connection."

The only other review they have is someone saying that they "can't sign up with wifi"

## Verdict

The Pons Group's [website](https://pons.group) can no longer be accessed. The app can be installed, but we cannot register due to an error. Without a website and a point of contact like a twitter account, we could not verify with Pons Group whether they are indeed related to Crypterium. We previously did a review on the DAO Wallet where we tried to verify with the developer if they are connected to the [daoconsensus.com](https://daoconsensus.com) domain, since their Google Play page links to [daoconsensus.ru](https://daoconsensus.ru), but [we did not receive a reply](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1453291043055710208). 

This time, we tried to verify with what we believe is the original app developer, Crypterium if they are related to {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.pons' %} and {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.pons.dao' %}.
