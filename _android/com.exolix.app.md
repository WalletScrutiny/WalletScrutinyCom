## App Description from Google Play

> Swap 400+ assets with a blink of an eye in the Official Exolix App!

>

## Analysis 

- All that was needed to sign up for an account was an email address. 
- We registered successfully and found a BTC balance. We can see that this is not a conventional exchange as it also has exchange widgets.
- We then look for an option to deposit. 
- We read the '[How to Use Exolix](https://exolix.com/how-to-use)' guide.
- It appears that this service is similar to {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.changelly.app' verdict='true' %}. Users can select a pair, and input a receiving address. The exchanged amount is then deposited to the receiving address. 
- This service does **not provide a wallet** to the end user.
