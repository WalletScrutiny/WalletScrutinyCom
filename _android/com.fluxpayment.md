### FAQ

> **How do I fund my Flux account**<br>
You can fund your Flux wallet by making a bank transfer to the account number assigned to your Flux account which you can find when you click on "Add Money" on your Flux wallet dashboard.

## The App

Usage of the app requires a BVN - Bank Verification Number and a Nigerian phone number. Users can send Naira via Flux user tag. 

## Verdict

We have not found any reference to private keys or seed phrases on Flux's website. The inclusion of a bank account and the requirement to provide the Nigerian BVN also hints to this app's **custodial** nature. The app **cannot be verified**.
