## App Description

> Crystal Wallet is aiming to connect the way between blockchain technology and community with a simple, secure and powerful digital asset management application.
>
> We have expanded our outreach to millions of users from a large number of countries with the target of becoming the world’s largest cryptocurrency wallet.
>
> Multi-chain support along with robust tokens management allow blockchain technology to integrate with your life seamlessly.

## The App

The app is a multi-currency wallet with the ability to provide a 12-word seed backup and restore from them. The initial loading screen allows users to "Create a Wallet" or "Restore Wallet". It is self-custodial.

## Verdict

We couldn't find a link to their source code and neither did searching the appID _'eu.crystalwallet.app'_ on Github [yield any wallet repositories](https://github.com/search?q=eu.crystalwallet.app&type=code). This means that even though the app may be **self-custodial**, having the **source code unavailable** for review makes the app **not verifiable**.
