## Analysis 

- The associated website for this app has gone offline since 2023 
- We tried the app on 2 virtual devices:
  - BlueStacks 5 Pie 
  - BlueStacks 5 Nougat 
- On both occassions the circle status bar just kept spinning with no error message or feedback of any kind. 
- We'll wait for the reply from ArumTrade's [twitter account.](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1656584775623376896)
- We emailed them as well at *info@arumtrade.com*
- We'll retain the **work-in-progress** verdict until more information is available.
