**Update:** This app is not supported by its provider anymore. As the name reads
"Lightning (Remove Funds by Dec 31st)" and the description talks about "3
months" we assume this app still being on Google Play is an accident.

From the description:

> 1. Install the app and follow the setup instructions.
> 2. Send a small amount of BTC to your wallet address (not more than you are
     willing to lose, it's alpha)
> 3. Wait a few minutes for the wallet to sync. Once completed, the app will
     open payment channels automatically. The funding transactions need to
     confirm just like regular on-chain transactions.

If it "sync"s and "open payment channels automatically", it is probably a
non-custodial app, although that is not said explicitly in the description.

But there is also a link to
[their GitHub](https://github.com/lightninglabs/lightning-app).

There is no word on the Android build on the main Readme.md but under
[mobile](https://github.com/lightninglabs/lightning-app/tree/master/mobile)
we find something ...

Deprecated Gradle features were used in this build, making it incompatible with Gradle 5.0.
Use &apos;--warning-mode all&apos; to show the individual deprecation warnings.

So we threw what we know at it but failed there.

We did not take the route using Android Studio, as that should never be necessary
as Android Studio itself uses gradle to build Android projects. For our purpose
a tool with graphical interface, involving clicking buttons is not practical as
build verification will be fully automated as it needs to be reevaluated after
each release.

So for now we hope for better build instructions so we can soon give it another
try and conclude this provider probably shares the source but it's **not verifiable**.
