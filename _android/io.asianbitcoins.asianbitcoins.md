## App Description 

> Bitcoin is actually peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. This is an (sic) open-source; its design is public, where nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part.

## Analysis 

- The app was last updated in 2020 
- We installed the app, basic login and registration functions do not work anymore. 
- The website for this app is no longer online (DNS address could not be found)
- We have reason to believe this app is already **defunct**.
