**Update:** [@StevieZollo](https://twitter.com/StevieZollo) sent a

  You can find its source code here: [https://github.com/OpenBazaar/haven](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/haven)

so we can check its source code after all. Let's see how that goes:

Just in case, we reviewed their website again if this is the official repo but
there is no link to it, so that doesn't leave us with much hope. Also: **Unless
the provider endorses this repository, you should not assume it is anything
official or trustworthy!** Anyway ...

```
/tmp$ git clone https://github.com/OpenBazaar/haven

```

So there is essentially only one revision as far as the Android app goes. Changes to
license or readme should not affect the app on Android itself. The missing tag
will be a problem later on though.

```
root@4be0f50e58d3:/mnt# apt install nodejs npm -y
root@4be0f50e58d3:/mnt# npm install -g npm yarn
root@4be0f50e58d3:/mnt# yarn
root@4be0f50e58d3:/mnt# apt install curl
root@4be0f50e58d3:/mnt# yarn
root@4be0f50e58d3:/mnt# find . | grep '\.env'
```

At this point, the build instructions read

> Copy `.env` file to the root directory

but according to `find . | grep '\.env'` there is no `.env` file anywhere. The
instruction:

> The env file should look like this:
> ```
> BRANCH_KEY=
> COUNTLY_ROOT_URL=
> COUNTLY_APP_KEY=
> STREAM_API_KEY=
> STREAM_APP_ID=
> HMAC_SECRET=
> ```

looks like the provider is not sharing all details necessary to build this app
but let's see what happens ...

It doesn't get better. Next we are supposed to

> Copy those files into `havenBuildConfigFiles` folder:
> ```
> AppCenter-Config.plist
> GoogleService-Info.plist
> appcenter-config.json
> google-services.json
> ```

and again those are not files provided by the company.

So to little surprise, compiling doesn't go all too well:

```
root@4be0f50e58d3:/mnt/android# cd android/
root@4be0f50e58d3:/mnt/android# ./gradlew clean assembleRelease
...
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':app:processReleaseGoogleServices'.
> File google-services.json is missing. The Google Services Plugin cannot function without it.

BUILD FAILED in 4m 14s

At this point we give up and give the verdict **not verifiable**.
