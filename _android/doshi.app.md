## App Description from Google Play

> - Collect NFTs or mint your own on Polygon using Doshiâ€™s AI technology
> - Get access to the latest DApps, NFT projects and blockchain-based Games.

The app claims to be a financial education app that allows users even as young as 13 to join.

## Analysis

- Section 29.2. Violation of the [terms](https://www.doshi.app/utilities/termsandconditions) gives Doshi the right to remotely access user's device and remove the app.
- When we installed the app, we were in 'school mode' - we couldn't access the wallet feature.
- From this [blog](https://www.doshi.app/post/5-must-know-tips-when-beginning-in-crypto-doshi) post we see that the app claims to be non-custodial, and supports buying bitcoin through its partnerships with regulated exchanges.
- We encountered some sign-in problems when testing the app.
- If we do a Google search using the 'site' parameter, with 'custody' or 'private keys' as the search term, we found some of their 'academy' articles referring to the app as a 'non-custodial' wallet with a 'special technology' for storing the private keys. We can't access this article or any similar references in any of its available online material.
- The current registration process does not provide the seed phrases or any other mechanism to backup the private keys.
- With the available information that we have, we will tentatively assume that this is a non-custodial wallet that supports bitcoin.
- We do not see any claims that it is source-available.
- Searching for the app ID on GitHub has [some possibly related repositories](https://github.com/search?q=doshi.app&type=code), but none that is conclusively the repository for the Android app.
- As an added note, its Head of Learning, one alleged, "Juan Giraldo" has a different name on LinkedIn when we search for using the profile image.
- For the meanwhile, we'll mark this app as **not source-available**.
- It's linked twitter account does not exist.
