**Update 2021-10-07**: This app is not on Play Store anymore.


From its Google Play app summary:

> 500 + trading assets: From exchange-traded funds and indices to commodities and shares of the worldâ€™s most popular companies. Trade Tesla, Netflix, Facebook, gold, silver, oil and more.

It has no website domain to glean information from. 

It is possible to deposit/withdraw in bitcoin, however clicking the deposit option from the app opens a browser with a url of api.trendofx.com. The first heading is labelled, "TrendoFx Crypto Payment Gateway". This gives it a feel of actually paying the service, rather than transfering to a wallet the user controls. 

Underneath the support option, it links to an iPhone version with a different name "Analise Forex & Stock". We included it here for reference. 

We determine this app to have **no bitcoin wallet**.
