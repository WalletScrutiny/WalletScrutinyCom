## Analysis

- Automatic account creation, with no procedures
- The seed phrase was available to view in advanced settings
- I requested Aqua wallet to provide build instructions using a Docker container. This app is **[for verification](https://github.com/AquaWallet/aqua-wallet/issues/31)**.

# 2024-05-26 Build Attempt

This Dockerfile sets up a development environment suitable for working with the Flutter and Rust technologies. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of each command in the Dockerfile:

## Base Image

- `FROM instrumentisto/flutter:3.10`
  - This command sets up the base image using `instrumentisto/flutter` at version `3.10`. This image is pre-configured with essential tools and libraries for Flutter development.

## Installing Rust

- `RUN curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y`
  - Installs Rust using `curl` to download and execute the Rust installation script from the official source. The `-y` flag automatically agrees to the license agreement and other prompts.
- `RUN source ~/.bashrc`
  - Sources the `.bashrc` file to ensure that the Rust environment variables are correctly set up for subsequent commands.
- `RUN rustup install 1.67.1 1.72.0 1.73.0 -y;`
  - Installs specific versions of Rust (`1.67.1`, `1.72.0`, `1.73.0`) using `rustup`. The `-y` flag is used to confirm installation without manual intervention.
- `RUN rustup default 1.67.1;`
  - Sets Rust `1.67.1` as the default version for the current environment.

## Installing Flutter Version Management (FVM)

- `RUN curl -fsSL https://fvm.app/install.sh | bash;`
  - Installs FVM (Flutter Version Management) using `curl` to download and execute the installation script. This tool helps manage multiple Flutter SDK versions.

## Setting Up the Working Directory

- `WORKDIR /mnt`
  - Sets `/mnt` as the working directory for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY, and ADD instructions that follow in the Dockerfile.

## Cloning the Repository

- `RUN git clone https://github.com/AquaWallet/aqua-wallet.git;`
  - Clones the `aqua-wallet` repository from GitHub into the working directory. This repository contains the source code needed for the project.

## Setting Flutter Version with FVM

- `RUN fvm use 3.10.6;`
  - Uses FVM to switch to Flutter version `3.10.6` for this project.

## Project Setup

- `RUN make setup;`
  - Runs the `make setup` command which typically involves setting up the project, installing dependencies, and performing initial configuration.

## Build Command

- `CMD ["flutter","build","apk"]`
  - Specifies the command to run by default when a container is started from the image. This command builds an APK using Flutter.

```
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

- What went wrong:
A problem was found with the configuration of task ':app:packageRelease' (type 'PackageApplication').
  - In plugin 'com.android.internal.version-check' type 'com.android.build.gradle.tasks.PackageApplication' property 'signingConfigData.signingConfigData.storeFile' specifies file '/mnt/android/android_keys/keystore.jks' which doesn't exist.

    Reason: An input file was expected to be present but it doesn't exist.

    Possible solutions:
      1. Make sure the file exists before the task is called.
      2. Make sure that the task which produces the file is declared as an input.

    Please refer to <https://docs.gradle.org/7.5/userguide/validation_problems.html#input_file_does_not_exist> for more details about this problem.

- Try:

> Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace.
> Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.
> Run with --scan to get full insights.
