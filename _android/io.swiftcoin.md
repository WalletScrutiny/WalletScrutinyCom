## Analysis 

- [Video](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1696856619483869656) 
- We installed the app and registered via email. 
- No mnemonic phrase was provided during start up. 
- There was also no option to back up the private keys in the settings.
- It supports a Bech32 BTC address among other cryptocurrencies.

Even though it is not explicitly stated, the app most likely stores the private keys on their servers since they did not provide a mechanism to back these up on the users' device. This makes it a *custodial* provider which makes the app **non-verifiable**.
