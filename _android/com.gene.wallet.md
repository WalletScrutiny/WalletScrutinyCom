## Analysis 

The app ran on an older version of Android, Nougat 32-bit. We successfully registered and found a Bitcoin wallet that can send and receive. However, there was no option to backup the private keys or restore the mnemonics. 

Its social media posts on twitter date all the way back to 2019. 

Interestingly their website is still online and we were successfully able to receive an email confirmation code. 

Without the private keys, this is a **custodial** app.

Note that this is most likely an obsolete app.
