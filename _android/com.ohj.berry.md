## Relation to apps of similar names such as:

- {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.berrywallet.wallet' verdict='true' %}
  - The developers for each app are different just like the brand identity, except for the name "Berry".
  - The websites listed on Google Play are different from each other
  - Both websites are currently offline.
- During our cursory examination, we find no link between the two apps.

## Updated Review 2023-07-24

- After reviewing this app, we decided to search for the app name + "scam". 
- We found several results indicating that this was a Ponzi scheme. 
- This explains the different branding identities we initially found online. The same "B" logo was colored differently.

## Analysis

- The app has no listed website.
- ðŸš© This app was released only on March 17, 2023 but already has 10000 downloads. The app description also states that it has over 8 years in experience.
- The app only shows the splash screen. Both on BlueStacks 5 and on an Android device.
- About 5 minutes later, we received a 504 Gateway Time-out error.
- Since the app does nothing overtly, we advise keep a wary eye on this. We can't say for sure if this is simply because the app was newly released (but it has 10000 downloads), but a non-functional app with these details, raises suspicions.
- We'll mark this as a work-in-progress for the meantime.
