## App Description from Google Play

> We provide safe and reliable digital asset trading and asset management services to 130 countries

## Analysis

- The app has no listed website.
- ðŸš© This app was released only on March 17, 2023 but already has 10000 downloads. The app description also states that it has over 8 years in experience.
- The app only shows the splash screen. Both on BlueStacks 5 and on an Android device.
- About 5 minutes later, we received a 504 Gateway Time-out error.
- Since the app does nothing overtly, we advise keep a wary eye on this. We can't say for sure if this is simply because the app was newly released (but it has 10000 downloads), but a non-functional app with these details, raises suspicions.
- We'll mark this as a work-in-progress for the meantime.
