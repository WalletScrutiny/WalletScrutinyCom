## Analysis 

- We installed the app but had problems registering. The password field would only accept numbers as characters.
- We also tried on BlueStacks 5 Android 7 and the same issue arose. 
- Finally, we tried on Android Studio emulator API 27, the installation status circle just kept circling. 
- We will try to contact the developers at tradebit2019@gmail.com
- The app has a secondary website, tradebit.in. It is no longer online. 
- Despite claims of being Open Source and self-custodial, the inaccessibility of the app, makes us disbelieve these claims. This is more likely **defunct**. Until such time that more information is available, we'll retain this meta-verdict.
