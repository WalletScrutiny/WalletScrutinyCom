## App Description from Google Play 

> Kamix allows you to buy and store crypto assets in your wallet, that you can send to your recipient's wallet in Cameroon with 0% commission fees. Before using this service, it is mandatory to validate your identity as required by Anti Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing regulations.
>
> Once your recipient receives the crypto assets, the app allows him to automatically sell it and receive franc CFA directly in his mobile money account Orange Money or MTN Momo. Therefore you must indicate your recipient's mobile money number in each transaction.

## Analysis 

- We installed the app but were not able to register due to AML/KYC and regional requirements. We did however, manage to register on the web app which only required an email address. 
- The Kamix.io website also has a blockchain explorer 
- We had contacted Kamix via [twitter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1654326997353627648) to clarify, however there was no response.

[Reading the Legal article](https://www.kamix.io/fr/legal), there are paragraphs that state the app is holding the user's assets. Unfortunately, as we cannot read French we had to run the article through Google Translate.

> **«Cryptoactive buyer»:** means a Customer who purchases a quantity of Cryptoassets sold by KAMIX against a settlement in euro by a payment method accepted by KAMIX, and, in particular, remote payment by credit card or payment by SEPA bank transfer.
>
> **«Crypto account»:** means a position-keeping register on which is recorded the quantity of crypto-assets held by a Client and kept by KAMIX as well as its counter-value in legal tender currency, in particular the’euro or the CFA franc.


We'll conclude that this app is **custodial.**
