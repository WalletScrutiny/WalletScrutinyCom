### Google Play Critical Reviews

  ★★☆☆☆ September 16, 2021 <br>
       The concept is nice, but the usability of the app is terrible. Navigation between ad-clicks is terrible. You have to click the back button on the in-built browser after eack ad view and then it takes you back to the login screen! And you have to login again to get to the next ad! The experience on a web browser is much better so avoid this silly app and use Star-Clicks from a web browser.

  ★☆☆☆☆ October 13, 2021 <br>
       They are cheating. Auto payout system is not working. I am a VIP Gold member. Still I didn't get any payments from the app.

## The App

We downloaded and registered. We uploaded an [image on twitter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1452539479873376260) of what the service looks like.

## Verdict

This app allows you to earn "bitcoins" by clicking on ads. You need to enter a third party wallet. Once you earn enough to reach their payout threshold, you can withdraw the bitcoin. This app is unable to store BTC and thus is **not made to function as a bitcoin wallet.**
