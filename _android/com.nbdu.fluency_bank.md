## Information from the [Website's Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20200212151209/https://www.fluencybank.com/) 

> The modules are located under 1,000 metres of granite in a heavily guarded bunker in Switzerland.

## Analysis 

- The website is no longer online and is parked.
- The last working [archive entry](https://web.archive.org/web/20200212151209/https://www.fluencybank.com/) of this app's website was made in 2020.
- This app was last updated in 2020.
- Based on the app description itself, **"We store your cryptocurrencies in dedicated hardware security modules** located in Swiss Alps", this would make it **custodial**. 
- However, when we tried to install the app on Blue Stacks 5 Android 9, it would not install. The Google Play circle just kept circling.
- The app's twitter account is no longer online.
- We tried again in Blue Stacks 5 Android 7, it just displayed a blank screen. 

### Conclusion 

Though we initially thought this app was custodial based on the description, most evidence including the website, the twitter account and the actual app itself points to a **defunct** app.
