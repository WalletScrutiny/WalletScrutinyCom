## App Description

> Start Wallet is a non-custodial decentralized wallet that will store your private key in a local sandbox file on the device. You can store, send and receive all tokens in this wallet.

## The App

The app was not compatible with our device, but we were able to download a Windows version of the application. It has BTC support, with the capability to export and import the private keys.

## Verdict

There is a [GitHub page linked in the StartEOS](https://github.com/StarteosIO) homepage, but it does not seem to point to the Android app. The repositories on its GitHub page are the following:

- [jeos](https://github.com/StarteosIO/jeos) - StartEOS Java/Android EOS LIBs
- [dappsdk](https://github.com/StarteosIO/dappsdk) - a dapp sdk
- [dappsdk-android](https://github.com/StarteosIO/dappsdk-android) - a library for Android native dapp
- [DappSDK-JS](https://github.com/StarteosIO/DappSDK-JS) - (no description)
- [dappsdk-iOS](https://github.com/StarteosIO/dappsdk-iOS) - a library for iOS native dapp
- [ScanProtocol](https://github.com/StarteosIO/ScanProtocol) - Forked from ScanProtocol/ScanProtocol

We could not locate the source code for the project.
