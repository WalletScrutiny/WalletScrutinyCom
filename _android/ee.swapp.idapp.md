>
> Swapp ID is a decentralized, permission-less digital identity and cross-chain wallet for users to create a unified digital ID.

       I can't seem to access the app. It just doesn't stop loading after registration and signing the agreement. Please fix it up!

       I Enter my secret recovery phrase to import My Wallet but it can not login. Please fix the problem.

## Analysis 

- The developer contact's listed website is no longer online.
- Upon app initialization, it asked us to provide a referral link. This doesn't work anymore. We found several referral links on twitter, and putting the swapp.ee links on the app interface does not do anything. There is no feedback.
- Together with the reviews, the non-functioning app, and offline website, we'll mark this app as **defunct**.
