## Analysis 

Choice further describes itself as:

> Today we power more than $18BN in Assets Under Custody and 125,000+ Accounts - so you could say we know a thing or two about tax efficient investment accounts.

They also have an option for users to use their own private key using another app, but the primary account is **custodial** and therefore non-verifiable.
