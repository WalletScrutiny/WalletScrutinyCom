## Analysis 

- [Screenshots](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1663741957330313216)
- We were able to install the app 
- The app includes a BTC wallet that can send/receive. It also has what it calls a Bitcoin Treasury wallet. 
- It also supports an instant messaging function. 
- We were not able to locate any option to backup the private keys.
- These facts, including its description that **"With get2coin, data is encrypted before leaving your device. It passes through our secure servers in the form of unstructured binary junk"**, lead us to the conclusion that this is a **custodial** provider.
