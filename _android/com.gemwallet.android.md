## Analysis

- We installed Gem Wallet app version 1.2.144 on our device. 
- Initialization began with wallet creation including the seed phrases.
- This app supports multiple coins including Bitcoin.
- There was an option to send and receive. The Bitcoin address was in the Bech32 format.
- As they claimed to be an Open Source project, we easily found their [repository](https://github.com/gemwalletcom/gem-android).

## Reproducibility Testing Attempt

We made a
[Dockerfile](https://gitlab.com/walletscrutiny/walletScrutinyCom/-/raw/d8e5f53c384b19035cb3447b34389d1fe59b7bfa/scripts/test/android/com.gemwallet.android.dockerfile)
and
[shell script](https://gitlab.com/walletscrutiny/walletScrutinyCom/-/raw/d8e5f53c384b19035cb3447b34389d1fe59b7bfa/scripts/test/android/com.gemwallet.android.sh)
that would build Gemwallet's Android App Bundle (.aab) within a custom image. 

The `bundletool` command would build an .apks archive from the .aab:

```
    RUN bundletool build-apks \
    --bundle=/home/gemwallet/gem-android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab \
    --output=/home/gemwallet/gem-android/device-app-release.apks \
    --device-spec=/home/gemwallet/device-spec.json 
```


## Running the build with testAAB.sh script

For Gemwallet, we thought it was appropriate to create a new script *testAAB.sh* for the purpose of testing reproducibility with an android app bundle. 

"TestAAB.sh" is a script modified from our original <strong>test script <a href="/testScript">(?)</a></strong>. It can pass arguments such as a device's specifications listed in a json file to a bundletool command that can generate the appropriate apk files from a bundle.

`./testAAB.sh -d ~/work/apk/com.gemwallet.android/1.2.144/ -s ~/work/device-spec/a11/device-spec.json`

In this instance, we generated **unsigned** apks with specific device data which we would then compare to the official apk extracted from a Play Store installation. Both the built and official apk's contents were extracted into folders using `unzip -d qq`. Here is the diff resulting from this:

```

Looking over the changes, [we noticed many of the differences pertain to read-and-write permissions, file permissions, and timestamps.](https://gitlab.com/walletscrutiny/walletScrutinyCom/-/merge_requests/708#note_2023566413)  Additionally, [in classes.dex](https://xrviv.github.io/walletScrutinyBuildCasts/www/diffoscope-results/android/com.gemwallet.android/1.2.144/diffoscope.classes.dex.html) as well as [classes2](https://xrviv.github.io/walletScrutinyBuildCasts/www/diffoscope-results/android/com.gemwallet.android/1.2.144/diffoscope.classes2.dex.html) and [classes3](https://xrviv.github.io/walletScrutinyBuildCasts/www/diffoscope-results/android/com.gemwallet.android/1.2.144/diffoscope.classes3.dex.html), many of the variables were changed or omitted with the reason for it being unexplained.

The huge diffoscope output for version 1.2.144 lead us to give a verdict of **nonverifiable**
