## Analysis 

- We were not able to install on both Android 7 and Android 9
- The description states that it was built specifically for the Sirin Labs {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/finney' verdict='true' %}
- The [Finney User Guide](https://sirinlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/finney_user_guide.pdf) in the Sirinlabs website details some features about the apps capabilities. (Search for the term 'FINNEY™ WALLET')
- In the User Guide, it details that the app can send and receive bitcoin and the hardware device has a special function to enable the user to sign with the private keys. 
- Without the ability to test if this is the same app on that device, we really can't say. This app was last updated in 2020, which is already 3 years old. 
- We'll leave it as a work-in-progress until more information is available.
- We emailed the provider at *finney@sirinlabs.com*
