       Takes almost 2 minutes to open (I wish I was exaggerating this). You cannot import other already individual existing wallets by private key into this app. The UI could use some serious work. I like ChangeNOW's overall service, but this app is a huge let down. Not using; Not recommended.

       Functional, but not optimized. The app is unbearable to use on my S22 Ultra, despite also having high speed internet. It seems like everything takes 5x longer to load/update compared to other wallets, such as Atomic Wallet or Trust Wallet.
       
## Analysis 

We downloaded the app and got the seed phrases. As the review mentioned, it took quite a bit of time to load. They make **no claims about the public availability of their code and we have not found their repository**.
