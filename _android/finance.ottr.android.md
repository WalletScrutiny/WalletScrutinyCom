## Analysis 

- The app required email and phone verification.
- It then required access to Google Drive.
- At this point it asked us to create a Solana wallet.
- It then asked us if we were a tax resident of America. We chose "no."
- Adding funds option allows us to select among:
  - Coinbase
  - Kado
  - MoonPay
  - Binance
- This is a Solana wallet, and we did **not find a BTC wallet**.
