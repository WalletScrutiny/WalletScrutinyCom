Coinbase Wallet â€” Crypto Wallet & DApp Browser certainly sounds a lot like
{% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.coinbase.android' verdict='true' %}
but this is actually a second wallet
[endorsed by the same Coinbase](https://wallet.coinbase.com/).

From their [FAQ](https://wallet.coinbase.com/faq/):

> Wallet is a user-custodied digital currency wallet and DApp browser.

so for us the next step would be to find the source and reproduce the app ...

On the same page there is a [link to GitHub](https://github.com/CoinbaseWallet)
but none to the actual repository. Neither is there on the Playstore description.

If we filter the list of repositories by those created by CoinbaseWallet, we get
[this list](https://github.com/CoinbaseWallet?type=source) of repositories that
most lack a description or a
[README.md](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-purpose-of-readme-file-on-GitHub).

Here is the list as we found it with the only three descriptions underlined in
green, none of which sounds much like an Android wallet:

![list of repositories](/images/CoinbaseWalletRepositories.png)

Tiny correction ... some of the projects have
[empty README](https://github.com/CoinbaseWallet/CBCore/blob/master/README.md)s.

So from the names, the only two repositories that might contain relevant code
are `CBCore` and `CBHTTP`, both of which contain a folder called `android`.

An Android app has an ID and this ID has to be referenced in its source code, so
at this point we search for this app's ID `org.toshi`
[within the organization](https://github.com/search?q=org%3ACoinbaseWallet+%22org.toshi%22&type=Code)
which yields zero results.

Searching all of GitHub we do find the string `org.toshi`
[here](https://github.com/wd1/android_appclient/blob/master/app/build.gradle#L32)
for example but as this is not linked by the company and two years old, we will
not try to build it to verify a recently updated app.

This is the point where we come to the verdict **not verifiable** given there is
no public source code to build the app from.
