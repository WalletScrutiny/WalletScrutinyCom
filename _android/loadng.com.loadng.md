## The Site

From the Homepage:

LoadNG claims you can sell Bitcoin on {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.paxful.wallet' verdict='true' %}

### Tutorials and How-tos

- [How to Generate a BTC address for LoadNG](https://loadng.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013987098-HOW-TO-GENERATE-LoadNG-UNIQUE-WALLET-ADDRESS)

> The system prompts you to generate a dedicated bitcoin wallet which automatically synchronizes with your LoadNG Account. All you need do is send any amount to the wallet generated, the system identifies it and pays the Naira equivalent with regards to the "Sell Bitcoin" Rate in Naira Instantly.

Absent the ability to properly register on the service, we've had to rely on the tutorials and how-tos. While the wording on the app makes it appear that it's generating a wallet in order to receive funds, it is in fact, generating a wallet so that users can send Bitcoin to sell. This bitcoin is then converted to Naira and deposited to the user's bank account.

LoadNG also has another offering called [LoadNG Business](https://loadng.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360014951537-Introducing-LoadNG-Business-You-Can-Now-Send-Bitcoin-To-One-Wallet-Everytime-Anytime-)

> Any Bitcoin that enters the wallet address gets Immediately recognized and credited to your set Naira bank account

## Verdict

Although the wording on the app's homepage documentation makes it appear that there is a wallet on the app, the bitcoins that are sent to the generated QR codes or addresses are actually converted to Naira and sent to the users' bank accounts. Initially, we thought this app to be custodial, however upon closer scrutiny, we conclude that it **does not function as a wallet.**
