## App Description

> It’s an all in one-digital-financial solution designed for speed and backed by unparalleled security, so you can do more with your digital cash network in real-time, right from the app. This means, your money, your way, for access and use right away. MOVO® is next-generation digital banking, with an all in one-digital-financial solution built to deliver fast transactions for your daily send, spend, receive, and pays.

MOVO describes itself as a digital banking solution. The only information it has about its crypto services is about the MOVO Chain:

> MOVO Chain® is a one-of-a-kind solution that allows cryptocurrency owners to easily convert their crypto into USD/Fiat and send it as cash value to anyone in the United States using their email address. Recipients can then use the value received immediately for everyday living expenses, account transfers, bill pay, or payments using a MOVO® Digital Debit Mastercard®.

MOVO Chain appears to allow fiat-only deposits and withdrawals.

## The Site

The Movo Chain has a [page](https://www.movochain.com/send-money) of its own, where its main purpose is to "Turn Your Crypto into Cash:"

> Convert your Cryptocurrency into USD and transfer it to your MOVO Account for same day use. Or, send it as cash value to anyone using an email address or mobile phone number.* If the recipient is not a MOVO® user, they simply can join MOVO® to accept their funds in seconds.

Because there's no indication that this app is meant to be used as a crypto wallet, we mark it as **non-verifiable.**
