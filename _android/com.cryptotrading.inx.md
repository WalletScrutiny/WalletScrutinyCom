## Analysis

- In its [General Terms](https://www.inx.co/legal/general-terms/), under Wallets, INX states that they have no control over wallets. Control over user funds is governed by a third-party which it does not mention.
- In INX's [EDGAR](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1725882/000121390020023202/ea125858-424b1_inxlimited.htm) filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, it is stated:

> INX Digital receives custody services for cryptocurrencies held on behalf of the clients of our INX Digital trading platform from BitGo Trust Company, Inc., a trust company duly organized and chartered in South Dakota, as the custodian (“BitGo Trust”). BitGo Trust describes itself as a “qualified custodian” as defined in Rule 206(4)-2 promulgated under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. We believe that BitGo Trust, together with its affiliate BitGo Inc., a multi-signature hot wallet service, which we refer to collectively as BitGo, is a leading provider of custody and wallet services for cryptocurrency trading, with the ability to support both “hot” and “cold” storage with a high degree of electronic and physical security, as well as transaction processing and reporting. See “Business—Overview—INX Digital Trading Platform.”

- These are the [supported cryptocurrencies:](https://crypto-support.inx.co/hc/en-gb/articles/8532441342993-How-to-deposit-cryptocurrencies-into-my-cryptocurrencies-balance-) BTC support is included.
- This app is **custodial**.
