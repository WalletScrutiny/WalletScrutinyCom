## App Description from Google Play

The description generally describes a cryptocurrency exchange.

## Analysis 

- We created an unverified account on the platform. 
- A multi-currency account was created with a Bech32 BTC address that was available for deposit. 
- Withdrawals are possible but with limitations due to our unverified status. 
- There are implicit indications of a custodial service such as: 
  - The ability to freeze transactions
  - Requiring to pass KYC in order to increase limits
- We were not provided with the mnemonic phrases
- No option to back up the private keys are available in the options.
- We determine that this is a **custodial** platform because the private keys were not provided to the user. This makes the app **non-verifiable**.
