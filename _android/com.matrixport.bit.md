### User Agreement

From the [Terms of Agreement](https://www.bit.com/enUserAgreement) - 7.1, **Termination**:

> You acknowledge and agree that BIT.COM **shall have the right to limit or suspend your access to the Platform and/or the Website, freeze your Account and/or the Balance** if (1) we suspect that you have violated any applicable laws and regulations, these Terms, the Trading Product Rules or other policies, procedures, or rules announced by the Company; (2) we are required to do so by a subpoena, court order, or other government order; (3) the Account is subject to or related to a pending litigation, investigation, and/or governmental proceeding; or (4) we notice and suspect that there are some unusual or unauthorized activities involved with the Account.

From 2.4: 

> You hereby understand and agree that you might be required to provide personal identification information to complete our client onboarding process pursuant to our KYC (“Know Your Client”), AML (“Anti-money laundering”) and CFT (“Counter-terrorist Financing”) programs. We may require such information during your Account registration process and on an on-going basis. You agree to provide us accurate, truthful and complete personal identification information and you agree to notify us when there is any change. **Fail to do so may lead to suspension or termination of your Account.**


## The App

We tried the app and registered an account. Upon signing up, the user is allowed to view the BTC Deposit Address. We can assume that coins can be stored in this app's "wallet."

However, we could not find any way to back up the wallets or find any private key.

## Verdict

With no indication whatsoever that this is meant to be a self-custodial wallet, we are compelled to mark this as a **custodial** wallet. It is **not verifiable.**
