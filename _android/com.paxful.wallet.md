According to their Playstore description:

> The bitcoin wallet app is also the ultimate companion tool to Paxful, one of
the worldâ€™s biggest peer-to-peer bitcoin marketplaces.

> Track your open trades on Paxful so you know the current status of your most
recent transactions as you buy and sell bitcoin

which sounds like a tool to manage coins on [paxful](https://paxful.com/).

Nowhere on the Playstore or on their website did we find a link to source code.

[Nowhere on GitHub](https://github.com/search?p=3&q=%22com.paxful.wallet%22) did
we find their applicationId `com.paxful.wallet` as an actual applicationId in
an Android project.

Our verdict thus is: **not verifiable** and probably custodial.
