## Analysis 

The app seems to be broken. We tried signing up for the service, but kept receiving an error related to the password. We tried several combinations, including big letters, small letters, number and symbols, but nothing seems to be accepted. 

Nevertheless, the app describes self-custody through the use of a mnemonic phrase:

Translated from Chinese using Google Translate:

> The mnemonic phrase of AlfredWallet is 13 English words, which is different from other wallet specifications. Please do not move the mnemonic phrase of AlfredWallet to other wallets for use, and do not disclose the mnemonic phrase to third-party websites. If the mnemonic phrase is leaked, asset losses may occur. , this service is not responsible.

Assuming that its claims about self-custody are true, we could **not find any reason to believe that it is source-available**.
