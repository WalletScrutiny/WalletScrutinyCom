Most centralized cryptocurrency exchanges do not provide the private keys to the wallets on the app or web platform. 

This is confirmed in this bitopro zendesk article, ["Is there a private key?"](https://bitopro.zendesk.com/hc/zh-tw/articles/360001215612-Is-there-a-private-key-)

> BitoPro is a website exchange platform that does not provide private keys to users.

It also has [identity verification](https://bitopro.zendesk.com/hc/zh-tw/articles/360015033812-How-to-purchase-Is-KYC-required-)

>To prevent fraud, tokens can only be purchased through the BitoPro Exchange.<br><br>
Users who would like to purchase need to register BitoPro and complete Level 1 verification.

Verdict is **custodial** and thus **not verifiable**.
