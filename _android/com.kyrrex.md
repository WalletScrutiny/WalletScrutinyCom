## Analysis

- The provider's [Terms and Conditions](https://files.my.kyrrex.com/terms_of_business.pdf)
- Section 4.2 of the terms explicitly state that the user's funds will be held by the provider.
- After registration, the app asked us to provide a 4-digit pin code.
- The app provides a cryptocurrency exchange service. We were able to find a P2SH BTC wallet with deposit and withdrawal functions.
- The security option only presented these options:
  - Change pin
  - 2FA
  - Change password
- There was no private key backup option.
- Together with the stringent terms, the lack of an option to backup the private keys lead us to conclude that this is a **custodial** app.
