## Analysis 

There are claims about being a Decentralized ID platform. This app is also known due to the popularity of one of its co-founders, Sam Altman, who became renown because of OpenAI's ChatGPT. It is a little unsettling that one of the main driving forces for AI, would also want to dip his hands in cryptocurrencies and identity verification. 

We installed the app because there are faint references to Ethereum and Bitcoin, although we suspect that Bitcoin is not natively supported as the focus on their copywriting seems to be more about their [WLD "World Tokens"](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/worldcoin-org/).

Their [FAQs](https://worldcoin.org/faqs) state: 

## What protocols and APIs are integrated into World App: 
  >
  > World App leverages the composability of Ethereum, via the Optimism mainnet, to mix and match some of the best, most trusted open protocols and APIs into a single, easy-to-use app.
  >
  > For example, World App wallets use account abstraction through SAFE contracts to increase security and enable gasless transactions. ENS usernames support friendly and easy peer-to-peer payments. Token trading is available through the Uniswap protocol, and Circle’s USDC enables users around the world to have always-on access to a fully-backed digital dollar. Frictionless fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat exchange in many countries is provided by licensed or registered partners around the world, including Ramp and MoonPay. 

## Findings

We [installed the app](https://x.com/dannybuntu/status/1829500880305185137), but have skipped sms-verification, and linking to Google Drive, among other things, to get a quick look at their wallet. Curiously, there was a "Buy Bitcoin" tab. But later on we saw that it was WBTC and not Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain. For all its complexities, this app currently **does not support a Bitcoin wallet**.
