### [Terms](https://www.tomya.com/kullanici-sozlesmesi) 

- The app has a termination clause with the power to suspend the user's account and access. 
- The app also has KYC and ID-verification procedures
- Section 4.22 describes the use of cold-storage facilities and the stewardship of users' funds.

## Analysis 

- We tried to register with the app, but failed. 
  - It asked us for a Turkish number
  - It also required a Turkish identification number 
  - There is a tick box stating 'I am a citizen of the Republic of Turkiye'
- Section 4.18 of Terms, describes that the app has control over deposits and withdrawals.
- The mention of cold-storage in the terms is a strong indicator for the **custodial** nature of the provider.
