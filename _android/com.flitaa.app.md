## App Description

Flitaa's description claims that it is an:

> all in one platform to store, buy, sell, swap, learn and earn crypto

There is no mention of private keys in the description, with Flitaa saying that wallets are protected with "multiple layers of security":

> Your wallet is protected on multiple layers of security to prevent theft.


## The Site

There is no mention of private keys anywhere, or any way to backup the cryptocurrency wallets. However, as this [tutorial]((https://help.flitaa.com/article/how-to-buy-crypto-on-flitaa)) says, it is possible to buy, send, and hold cryptocurrencies with this app.

We tried to sign up through the site, however the registration form only accepted numbers from Ghana, Kenya, and Nigeria.

The terms of use located at the footer of the home page, only points to the same page.


## Verdict

All signs point to this being a **custodial** app and thus it is **not verifiable.**
