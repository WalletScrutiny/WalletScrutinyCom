## App Description from Google Play 

> The main advantages of this wallet include:

> - very low fees
> - simplicity and clarity

## Analysis

- Users are given several login options:
  - No login (for testing)
  - Email
  - Username and password
- If the user chooses to have an account, it would look something like
`dannybuntu@bitcoli.com`
- Users are primarily given a lightning address, but an onchain address is also available.
- We did not find the private keys for the onchain wallet. Absent the private keys, this app is **custodial**.
