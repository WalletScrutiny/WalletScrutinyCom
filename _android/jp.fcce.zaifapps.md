## The App

We were not able to register with the app as they have numerous questions documentary requirements which include:

> - Profession
> - Yearly Income
> - Status of Financial Assets
> - Do you possess debt?
> - Is your fund surplus or is it reserved for crypto asset management?
> - Motive and background of becoming a user

## Contact

We [contacted Zaif's twitter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1451085177447280645) to verify whether they stored the private keys on their servers or if it's with the user.

## Verdict

All indications point to a government regulated and centralized cryptocurrency exchange. We were not able to find documentation concerning the private keys for the user. At this juncture, we can conclude that this service is **custodial** and the app is **not verifiable**.
