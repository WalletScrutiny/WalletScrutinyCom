> From commodities trading to crypto, via cocoa and coal, InvestXE opens the door to thousands of markets all over the world through a single Bitcoin Based Account. No other provider offers more alternatives.

## The Site

From the [Terms of Service, 2.13](https://investxe.com/legal/terms-and-conditions):

## The App

We downloaded the app and were able to find a crypto wallet. There is a deposit address or QR code for depositing BTC.

## Verdict

This app is **custodial** and thus **not verifiable.**
