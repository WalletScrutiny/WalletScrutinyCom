As an official lite version of the app, this is also a **custodial** and therefore **non-verifiable** app.

## Analysis 

- We're in the [process](https://twitter.com/dannybuntu/status/1681984659696287744) of confirming on twitter and via their support desk form, if the lite version is an official app. 
- We noticed a difference in the developers. 
    - The BTCC developer is [BTCC.com](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=BTCC.COM)
    - The {{ page.title }} is [BTCC International](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=BTCC+international)
    - In iOS, the BTCC app developer is [BTCC Global Limited](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/btcc-global-limited/id1462880008). 
    - The iOS developer for {{ page.title }} is [BTCC Limited](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/btcc-limited/id1109290846)
- We were able to register on the lite version, and the credentials there were the same when we logged on to the website. The only suspicious details are:
    - The lack of links from the main website pointing to {{ page.title }}
    - The different developers
    - The developer contact does not list btcc.com as the website. 
- They have replied via email. We therefore mark this as **custodial** with a **non-verifiable** app.
