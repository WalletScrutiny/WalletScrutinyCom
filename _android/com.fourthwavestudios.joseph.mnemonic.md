## App Description from Google Play 

> Use to generate seed phrases, secret words. It uses the word list from BIP-39 and all phrases has a correct checksum. No ads. No storage or other permissions needed. We can not help you recover any phrases after the app is closed or new phrases are generated.

## Analysis 

Although it can generate BIP-39 seed phrases, a mnemonic generator is not a wallet. 

As Chat GPT would say: 

> No, a 12-word mnemonic generator is not a wallet. A mnemonic generator is a tool used to create a set of words that can be used as a seed phrase to access a cryptocurrency wallet. The wallet itself is a digital application or physical device used to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies. While the mnemonic generator is a critical component in accessing a cryptocurrency wallet, it is not the wallet itself.
