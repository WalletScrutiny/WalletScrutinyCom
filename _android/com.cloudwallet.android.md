## App Description

It was described as a multicurrency wallet.

We could not sign in to the app since it is giving us a 'Network Connection error' even though our device is fully connected to the Internet. 

Registration requires a referral code. 

We believe this product has been discontinued.

  Horrible app, cant even log in, get sum kind of weird error. When it was working, they were quick to accept any deposits u made, but its nearly impossible to withdraw, or get any kind of support. I want my money back, i been SCAMED, but looks likes im gonna have to contactthe fbi to do so..

  Good thing I put in a very small amount of litecoin to test out the app. At first i was earning cto which is good so it worked but then I tested to see if i could withdraw my litecoin after a couple months and it's been longer than 6 months since I requested to withdraw and still won't allow it. I'm sad my litecoin is lost but glad I didn't put a huge amount in. Never put all your eggs in 1 basket if it seems shady or new.
