**Update 2022-01-03**: Although there is a replacement app on Google Play, the app still points to the same developer website (coinbene.com), which is still [404 as of today](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1477969064806916103). The telegram channel indicated in the iOS app page, now points to 'null'

**Update 2021-10-01**: This app now appears to have a successor on Play Store, [CB Global](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mingyue.liuli).

**Update 2021-09-07**: This app is not on Play Store anymore.

> CoinBene makes no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time that may be required to complete transfer of your Tokens from a third party wallet or other source and have such Tokens become available in your Account.

This is an indicator of its custodial nature.
