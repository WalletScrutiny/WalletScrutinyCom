## Analysis

- We downloaded the app and found a BTCUSD pair.
- User actions involve:
  - Buy/Sell Market Range
  - Limit
  - Take Profit
  - Stop Loss
- We could not find any reference to 'Bitcoin' or 'Crypto' in any of the documentation. Since this is a CFD trading platform, we presume that the BTCUSD pair we saw is CFD cryptocurrency trading.
- Just to be sure, we asked them on [twitter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1675077669359169537).
- For the meanwhile, we'll mark this as an app that **cannot send/receive bitcoin**, because withdrawals and deposits are only in Euro.
