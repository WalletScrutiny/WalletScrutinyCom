**Caution:** Cloud mining apps that run on a phone with no reference to a mining facility and require referrals are generally shady projects that are not really into mining. Users are cautioned regarding apps like these. 

## App Description

> Instead of sitting idle, you can make money through your mobile phone. **BTC Network provides you with a one-click solution that allows anyone anywhere to make money.**

  ★☆☆☆☆ October 5, 2021 <br>
	I downloaded this app yesterday, eversince I finished my 3rd session, I have not been able to mine. I keep getting the notification that mining session has ended , Everytime I click the B sign, it keeps losing for minutes , pop up an AD and then take me back to where I was, it not even showing me my balance anymore. Fix this please

  ★★☆☆☆ October 6, 2021 <br>
	I'm giving this app 2 stars because there is no withdrawal option given by the developing team. If this issue is resolved I'm going to give 5 stars because overall it appears to be a good project.

## The Site

From the official site's ["whitepaper:"](https://btcnetwork.in/white-paper/)

> Their Satoshi balance will be stored and safe on the BTC Network app’s cloud server.

There are no options to withdraw or deposit btc.


## The App

The app allows you to click a button purportedly to start "mining." It is doubtful that clicking a button would start mining without reference to a mining facility, rig, or hardware.

## Verdict

It cannot be proven that this app has a bitcoin wallet.
