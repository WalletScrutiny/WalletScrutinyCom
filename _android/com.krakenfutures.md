This is the interface for an exchange and nothing in the description hints at
non-custodial parts to it.

It also appears [you can only transfer funds to and from your Kraken account.](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022627692-Transferring-funds-to-and-from-the-Holding-Wallet#:~:text=Navigate%20to%20%E2%80%9CWallets%E2%80%9D%20on%20the,that%20the%20transfer%20was%20requested.)
