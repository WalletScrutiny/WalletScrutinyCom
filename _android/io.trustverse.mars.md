## Analysis 

- Once we opened the app, it opened a browser page to a subdomain of trustverse.io. (This is strange because the primary domain, trustverse.io shows a GoDaddy parking page. The www.trustverse.io domain shows the website.) There we filled out our profile and verified both our email address and phone number.
- We were provided with a 12-word seed phrase.
- We found a BTC wallet that can send and receive.
- There were no claims that the app was public source, but they do have a [GitHub](https://github.com/trustverse) organization page.
- GitHub Code only has 2 results when we searched for the app ID, both were related to WalletScrutiny and unrelated to the possible source of the Android app. 
- The app is **not source-available**.
