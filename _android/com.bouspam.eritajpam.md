## Analysis 

- The website is no longer online
- We downloaded the app and it looks like an exchange, with tickers, account and wallet icon.
- Before users can deposit or withdraw Bitcoin, they must pass KYC [(Screenshot)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1648991059404550144)
- We contacted the provider via [twitter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1648994280172818433) since this app was recently updated on April 4, 2023. 

User asset segregation into hot and cold wallets as a security mechanism, implies that this is a **custodial** provider. We're still following up on why its website is no longer online.
