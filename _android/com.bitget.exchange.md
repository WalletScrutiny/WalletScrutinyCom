**Update 2021-09-12**: This app appears to be back on Play Store

**Update 2021-08-05**: This app is not on Play Store anymore.

Given Bitget refers to itself in the title as a "Crypto Trading & BitCoin Contract Platfom" it is presumably custodial.

In Bitget's website, under the "Security" feature:
> Supports Dedicated/Multi-signature for Cold/Hot Wallet

Also in the Play store description:

> Protecting the safety of your assets is our top priority. The wallet we use has multiple physical isolations and supports dedicated personal multiple signatures.

This is *also* very usually an indicator that this product is **custodial** thus **not verifiable.**
