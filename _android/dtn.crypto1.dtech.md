>
> This Software ONLY utilities Tools, we use third party server and third party broker.


## Analysis 

- The associated developer website is not online 
- There was a registration and login section under 'Account'. Attempts to login or register failed. The 'loading' status circle just kept rotating. After a while it showed an error: 

> Error: [object Object]

- We did not find a wallet after we installed the app. Though there was an option to deposit/withdraw DOGE, the app only shows the address when the user has logged in. We find it odd, that it was displayed outside the login interface.
- We sent an email to: admin@bisnis188.tech
- All indications point to a non-working app that is very probable to be **defunct** and slight indications of supporting a dogecoin wallet, but **no bitcoin support.**
