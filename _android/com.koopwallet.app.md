## Analysis

- The first step is to create or import a new wallet.
- We then named the wallet and the app then provided us with the 12-word mnemonics. We confirmed this.
- We picked a username and chose 'public'.
- Next, we entered a 4-digit security pin.
- We were then brought to the main interface which is also the 'Portfolio' page.
- There are two buttons send and receive. We chose "Receive" and we were then presented with a choice of coins: BTC, ETH, BNB, LTC, TRX, MATIC, CELO and KOOP(Bep20). We selected BTC and it gave an error:

> Please Wallet Reselect and try again.

- This happened as well with other coins.
- In the previous screen there is a search bar and we typed in 'BTC'. A search for BTC did not yield any results.
- We [tweeted](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1677200695299129344) them about this, but currently assume their non-custodial claims.
- Just the same, if we search for the app ID in GitHub Code, we get [0 results](https://github.com/search?q=com.koopwallet.app&type=code).
- This brings us to conclude that this app is **not source-available**.
