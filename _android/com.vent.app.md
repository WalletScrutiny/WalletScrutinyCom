## Analysis 

- After registration and just after logging in, the app required bank verification by having the user input his bank account number. We were not able to proceed beyond this point.
- We were able to access the [Terms](https://app.vent.africa/terms) with references and hints to their custodial character: 
- Section 7.2 of the terms states that cryptocurrencies held in the user's account will be forfeited in favor of Vent (subject to conditions found in other sections)
- Section 4 of the terms requires the user to provide the provider with information about the cryptocurrency they wish to trade. This section also details the provider's power to disallow a trade. 
- We have sufficient information to give this app a verdict of **custodial**, but we'll email them just to be sure at help@vent.africa.
