**Update 2023-05-05**: The app is available once more.

## App Description from Google Play 

> The Lisk Mobile wallet offers a user-friendly interface to both safely and securely manage your LSK tokens, view your transaction history, and account balances. With each new release further enhancements and new features will be added.
Features

> -  Effortlessly send and receive LSK tokens.
-  Register a new Lisk account by generating a single passphrase.
-  Simple and secure account sign in.

## Analysis 

An [announcement](https://lisk.com/blog/posts/lisk-desktop-220-release) was made about discontinuing BTC support for the wallet on November 26, 2021.

> Last but not least, we are removing the Bitcoin support to pave the way for Lisk interoperability next year.

Suffice to say, the app **does not support BTC anymore**.

## Previous Review 2021-08-20 

**Update 2021-08-20**: This app is no more on Play Store.
