## The Site

From the [Terms of Use](https://aladiex.com/term_of_use), Termination of Agreement:

> You agree that AladiEx shall have the right to immediately suspend your account (and any accounts beneficially owned by related entities or affiliates), freeze or lock the funds in all such accounts, and suspend your access to AladiEx for any reason including if it suspects any such accounts to be in violation of these Terms, our Privacy Policy, or any applicable laws and regulations.

### Notes

The website's FAQ/help center is closed and the iOS version is not functioning.

## The App

We tried the app and created an account. The app looks like an exchange and you can withdraw and deposit crypto with QR codes and a deposit address. There is no way to backup the wallets or view private keys.

## Verdict

This app is **custodial** and as such **not verifiable.**
