## App Description from Google Play

  > Non-Custodial Multi-wallet >> Manage any number of cryptocurrencies across multiple portfolio-style wallets in a non-custodial manner. This wallet is like your own bank where you are the only client and the only one in charge. Itâ€™s designed to keep assets secure and easy to restore even if the phone is stolen and tampered with.
  >
  > A Bitcoin Wallet >> The wallet packs some of the most advanced Bitcoin features available: SPV enabled, BIP 44/49/84/69 compliant, Bitcoin timelocks, custom transaction fees, and more.

## Analysis 

- The app claims to be self-custodial. 
- We found a BTC wallet that can send/receive. 
- It then asked to back up the private keys. 
- We were not able to find claims that the app is source-available.
- We searched GitHub Code for the app ID, and found [0 results.](https://github.com/search?q=io.fastewallet.bankwallet&type=code)
- This app is **not source-available**.
