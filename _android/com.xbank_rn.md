## App Description from Google Play 

> xBank 3.0 is an All-In-One portal for Web3 and cryptos, your key to what’s next in the Web3 world. Explore Web3 and crypto opportunities, set up multi-chain identities, pay with a trustful gateway, hold digital assets safely, and more.
>
> xBank also makes it easy for you to securely store, send and purchase Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH)/BUSD/USDT, Solana (SOL), DOGE, and hundreds of mainstream cryptos, including ERC20 tokens.

## Analysis 

- [Section 5.1 of terms](https://xbank.plus/terms-of-service/en#_Toc93706707), **explicitly indicates that the platform offers a custodial wallet**.
- Curiously, the product documentation states that it is non-custodial.
- We tried to register, but the app automatically closes after inputting the last digit of the email verification OTP. 
- Since we cannot use the app properly, we would have to go by the Terms and Conditions - which is the legal document that takes effect once the user signs up for the service.
