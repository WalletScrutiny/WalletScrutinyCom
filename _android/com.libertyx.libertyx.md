From its Google Play description:

> LibertyX: Buy bitcoin instantly from trusted stores near you<br>
1) Find a nearby store/ATM<br>
2) Follow the specific store payment instructions<br>
3) Bitcoin is sent immediately to your address

This app partners with vendors and kiosks to allow the user to buy bitcoin. The app itself is not a wallet. 

From its Zendesk support page:

>**Step 2. Create an Order**<br><br>
Once you select your purchase location, you will be asked for your bitcoin address so we can send you it immediately after payment. **If you do not have a bitcoin wallet, there are many free versions available.**

This app **does not provide a wallet**.
