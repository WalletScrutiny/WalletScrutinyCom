## The Site

### Trading Giftcards for Bitcoin

**How do I get paid?**

> After successful validation of your Giftcards the trade value is added to the customerJeroid’s (sic) wallet.

## The App

We were asked to register an account and had to input details such as name, phone number, and confirm our email addresses via an OTP. We were also asked to set a PIN for the account and add a bank account.

> Please add your Nigerian Bank Account **to receive funds from your transactions.**

When selling Bitcoin, we are presented with a dropdown menu with 4 options:

- Blockchain
- Binance
- Bitcoin ATM
- Others

## Verdict

The app seems to facilitate the trading of gift cards, represented in Naira. However, funds will be withdrawn to the user's bank account in fiat. This app is **not meant to hold your bitcoins.**
