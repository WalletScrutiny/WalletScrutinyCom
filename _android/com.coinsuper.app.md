**Update 2022-01-14**: This app is not available anymore.

## App Description

Self-described in Google Play:

> Founded in 2017, Coinsuper is a Hong Kong-based digital assets trading platform and self-regulated **custodian** platform. 

## The Site

We briefly checked the site, and quickly noted the list of cryptocurrency pairings, price and statistics. An option to download an iOS version is also visible.

## Verdict

We did not download the app anymore due to its self-description as a custodian service. Verdict is **custodial** and thus **not verifiable**.
