>
>- Add your favorite exchanges

## Analysis 

At the bottom of the homepage, you'll find the text: 

> Tuned is not a broker-dealer, exchange, custodian, wallet provider, or counterparty.

- The app is country-restricted so we were not able to install it. The description is sufficient to make a verdict.

This app **does not have a wallet.**
