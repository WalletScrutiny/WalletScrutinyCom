## Analysis 

- We signed up with the service using the web platform
- There was a wallet option, but this was inaccessible unless we performed KYC and provided proof of our physical address. 
- Article 8 of the [terms](https://knaken.eu/terms-and-conditions/) has the provider talking about providing "temporary wallets" that presumedly does not have the private keys. They describe this as a temporary measure because of current regulations. 
- Article 9 describes their staking services used in conjunction with the Knaken Wallet. 
- Keywords associated with custodial services include:
  - freezing of user accounts
  - blocking of access
  - termination of user accounts

Although the use of cold-wallets by the platform was not explicitly stated, we can find descriptions of the provider holding the user funds. Some examples:
 
  > *Now, Knaken can hold Bitcoin for people to buy and sell.*
  >
  > *Doing so may result in you being unable to access your Bitcoin. If you donâ€™t want to worry about this, you can store your crypto in your Knaken account.*

The "temporary wallet" without the private keys can only be a **custodial** service, making the app **non-verifiable**.
