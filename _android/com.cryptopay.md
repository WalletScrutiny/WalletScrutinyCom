**Update 2022-01-15**: This app is not on the Store anymore.

This wallet claims to be non-custodial but we cannot find any source code on their [official Website page](https://shamlatech.com/).

Our verdict: This app is **not verifiable**.

Tried to make contact to discover source code repository...
- Website chat - no response
- Telegram - cannot find the posted user/group.
- Whatsapp - wanted to make contact via a phone number which i declined.
