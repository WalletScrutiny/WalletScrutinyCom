Dropbit was a custodial lightning wallet and appears to still be a non-custodial
on-chain bitcoin wallet. As all funds on the lightning side are locked up with
no comment from the provider
([who apparently is in jail](https://www.reddit.com/r/DropBit/comments/fmgoad/sats_stuck_in_dropbit_lightning_side/)),
we mark this wallet as defunct for now.
