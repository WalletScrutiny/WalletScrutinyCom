## Analysis 

- The website is not online through our normal connection. To access the website, we used TOR.
- During registration, the app gives us a message that the app has sent a verification email. We received no such email. 
- On the web interface, the same event gave us an unnamed error with only an 'x' as an error. 
- We emailed them to ask about the status of the app dev.sinance@gmail.com
- The terms has a termination clause that disallows the user from accessing or using the platform. 
- Either the site and app is still undergoing development, or it is in the process of becoming defunct. We'll wait for further developments. Meanwhile, we'll keep this as a **work-in-progress.**
