## App Description from Google Play

> Coinmama is the self-custody wallet that gives you full control of your crypto. With Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH) support, the Coinmama crypto wallet lets you safely and confidently buy and store your digital assets. No intermediaries. No third party custody. No customer deposits.

## Analysis

- The app claims to support BTC and is self-custodial.
- We tested the app on our mobile device and the first options were to 'Create wallet' or 'Import wallet'. We selected the former. 
- The app wanted access to photo and media. We approved and then were given the 12-word seed phrases. We confirmed these.
- We were then given the chance to enter a passphrase and the chance to download a recovery archive file.
- It then prompted us for biometric scanning of our finger.
- We tapped on the 'Market' icon on the bottom panel and selected 'BTC'. It showed us the price of bitcoin.
- We then tapped on 'Home' and selected 'BTC'. These were the options: send, receive, sell, and buy. The app provided a Bech32 address.
- We searched for the app ID on GitHub's Code search, and found [2 results](https://www.instagram.com/officialcoinmama/), both are from Walletscrutiny.
- The provider does not make any claims their product is source-available.
- The app is not **source-available**.
