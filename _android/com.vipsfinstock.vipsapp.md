## Analysis

- We registered and found a cryptocurrency exchange interface. We also found a BTC wallet whose functions can only be accessible after KYC-verification has been accomplished.
- There are staking, market and trade options.
- The 'settings' option does not contain private key backup.
- Section 1.1.3 of the [Terms](https://vipsfinstock.com/terms), describes the service provided as facilitating the online storage of cryptocurrency owned by users.
- Most of the terms have provisions that are characteristic of **custodial** providers:
  - legitimacy of fund sourcing
  - Section 15. Termination
  - Section 2.10 Capacity to disable user's access to the account
  - Section 3.2.3 Withdrawals are subject to approval of provider
  - Section 3.1 Imperative to refuse to carry out user transaction orders and to relay information to enforcement authorities.
- Based on the information above, we determine this app as a **custodial** service.
