## App Description from Google Play 

> RamzinGate provides a platform for direct buying and selling and real-time conversion of Bitcoin, Tether - Turkish lira and other cryptocurrencies.

### [Terms](https://ramzingate.com/client/v2/TERMS) 

## Analysis 

- The site is in Persian and we translated using Google translate 
- We reached out to the site's chat support to verify the scope of their services. We [confirmed](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1664535553725935616) that the app **does not provide a wallet.** 
- The user can input an amount to be exchanged and the corresponding cryptocurrency. The platform will then provide an equivalent rate with the exchanged cryptocurrency.
