       They won't allow you to withdraw your profit after successfully trading with the $100 given.. Requesting for a deposit before you can withdraw.. Looks very scamish
       
## Analysis 

This app has many negative reviews and scam allegations on social networks. The homepage is no longer online and the app simply shows the splash screen [(Twitter Screenshot)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1646005334757249024). 

We'll mark this app as defunct and **custodial**, as the app description states on the [archived homepage](https://web.archive.org/web/20220518081049/https://vstmex.com/):
 
> - The use of cold wallets to storage important assets
> - Two-factor authentication
> - Customer insurance funds – We created an Insurance Asset > - Fund for Users (IAF), where we store 2% of the received trading fees to protect VSTMEX’s users and their crypto assets.
> - Our own anti-fraud department
> - Passing security audits -the System and Organization Control audits (SOC 1,2,3,4)

We deemed it defunct because the homepage is no longer online (domain for sale), which could be a reason for all the complaints. 

The service is custodial, and the app **cannot be verified**.
