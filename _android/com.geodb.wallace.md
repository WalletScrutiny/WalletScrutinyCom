## App Description

> Data Sharing Rewards: Turn your data into revenue without compromising your privacy. Choose to share your data securely and anonymously and in return, earn crypto rewards. Your personal information remains confidentail while you make positive impact by contributing to meaninful insights and market trends. 

As to what data is being shared, makes me want to remove this app ASAP. Anyway, it didn't work from the moment [we installed it.](https://x.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1831298909903495432). 

Its homepage [hasn't been accessible](https://web.archive.org/web/20240401000000*/https://wallacewallet.io) for quite some time.

Yet it claims:

> Gamified Experience: We've turned managing your finances into an exciting adventure.

Seems like a *very red flag.*

> Non-Custodial Security: Take full control of your cryptocurrency holdings with our non-custodial wallet. Wallace Wallet encrypts your seed phrase safely in your device locally using the latest encryption algorithms. We don’t store your keys in our systems so you have full control of your funds.

       It is the worst app ever. They don't want to give any penny to the players. Their spinning wheel is the number one fraud. Always, the needle is in a black hole. I'm wasting my time here for nothing. There are plenty of other crypto apps they are paying decent prices.
