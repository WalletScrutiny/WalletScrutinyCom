This is the companion app for {% include walletLink.html wallet='bearer/coldstoragecoins' verdict='true' %}. 

## App Description from Google Play

> Easily keep track of your Cold Storage Coins

## Analysis 

- The app works either by scanning the QR code at the back of the physical bearer token (highly likely to be the public key) or by entering the 6-digit coin ID manually. The private key is laser etched and can only be seen once the sticker seal is removed.

This is **not a wallet**, so the user cannot send and receive using this app. This is simply a tracker, that converts the value of the bitcoin to fiat according to the prevailing rate at the time. Another wallet could be used to redeem. [Details here](https://blockchainmint.com/pages/redeem)
