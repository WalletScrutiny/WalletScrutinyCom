## Analysis 

- This is a cryptocurrency exchange.
- There are many hallmarks that show this is a custodial provider, this can mostly be seen in the [terms](https://help.bitmake.com/hc/en-us/articles/4638528296847-Bitmake-Terms-of-Service):
  - Right to suspend user accounts
  - Right to freeze transactions
  - Power to lock assets
  - Right to full custody of assets when user violates the terms
  - Right to control the user assets
- After registration, we found a P2SH BTC address. We were not provided with a mnemonic phrase. 
- We checked the settings to try and look for a method to back up the private keys, but found none.

Without explicitly stating the use of cold-wallets or separate offline wallet mechanisms, the app exercises a lot of controls. The absence of mechanisms to back up the private keys is the major indicator of a **custodial** provider, with a **non-verifiable** app.
