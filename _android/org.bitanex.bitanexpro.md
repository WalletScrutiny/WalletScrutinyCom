       The trading button is not working. The support can't tell the problem.

       I have just installed the pro version and i'm having issues navigating around the app. For some reason my wallet isn't showing any figures - how do I get this sorted?

## Analysis 

We initially tried to install this app on BlueStacks 5 - Android Pie, but an error appeared informing us that the app could not run on this version of Android. We reverted to Android Nougat, an older version to test it. 

- When we installed it and later on opened it, the app would simply show the splash screen and then automatically close. 
- This app was last updated in 2019 
- It is most likely **defunct**
