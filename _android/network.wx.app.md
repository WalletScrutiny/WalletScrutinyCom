## App Description from Google Play 

> Our versatile app is a convenient solution for buying, selling, trading and investing BTC, ETH, USDT and other popular cryptocurrencies.
>
> Choose the type of account and start managing your funds in just a couple of minutes. Alternatively, you can log in using a seed phrase, Ledger or Email.

## Analysis 

- The developer contact email domain is similar to the developer contact email domain for {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.wavesplatform.wallet' verdict='true' %}
- Three login options are available, through mnemonic phrase, an email linked user-account and through ledger. 
- We checked the app and found what appears to be BTC wallets. But when we looked again, they're all under the WAVES blockchain. [Screenshots](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1668527108392378369)
- Thus, this app does **not provide support for the Bitcoin blockchain.**
