## App Description from Google Play 

> Amon is a Crypto Multi-product Wallet that allows users to buy, exchange, invest and spend both cryptocurrencies and traditional currencies. The Amon Wallet is powered by a unique AI system that suggests you the best performing crypto to spend at the moment of the purchase.

## App Description from Website 

There is an announcement found in a small flashing bar in the header:

> Amon has currently stopped its wallet operations.

Otherwise, the other text shows: 

> Secured with BitGo
>
> The BitGo Wallet is an institutional-grade, cold wallet for cryptocurrencies. Multi-signature, three-key management removes any single point of failure and advanced security configurations ensure that assets are secure.

- In the web-platform, we could not find any link to Register, only login. 
- The same is true with the mobile app.
- Any provider that has the capability to "pause" wallet operations or access to the wallet, is a **custodial** provider.
