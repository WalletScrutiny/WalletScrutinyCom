## App Description 

> AIRWALLET is a mobile cryptocurrency wallet that enables users to store and manage various cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum (ETH), and ERC-20

## Analysis 

- We tried on several platforms:
  - Android Emulator
  - BlueStacks 5 Pie 64-bit 
  - BlueStacks 5 Nougat 32-bit
- We either got an unresponsive app that does not do anything or an app that displays an error stating that it is incompatible with our device.
- The listed Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn account listed on the site @airwallet_hq has been deleted. 
- AirWallet has a [bounty program](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5074548.0) on BitcoinTalk.org
- We sent an email to info@airwalletofficial.com 
- While we wait, let me just point out that this is very likely to be a **defunct** app that is no longer working.
