## App Description from Google Play 

The app is currently not on Google Play, however the website is still online. 

## App Description from the website

> Bank-level security, hot-cold storage, and multiple verifications

The website also claims to support BTC. 

> HD Wallet 
>
> Manage multi-chain assets with one set of mnemonic words;
have full control over your own private keys;

## Analysis 

- With no app to test, we can only work with the information provided on the website. 
- The last tweet was made on July 2019.
- It makes claims that it supports both hot-cold wallets, but in another section of the site claims that user has control over the private keys. 
- If not yet **defunct**, the app is most likely a hybrid self-custodial and custodial wallet. 
- We will email them to inquire about the status of their app.
- While we wait, we'll keep this as a **work-in-progress**.
