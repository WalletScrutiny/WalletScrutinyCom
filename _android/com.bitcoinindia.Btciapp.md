In the description we read:

> India’s Most Secure Bitcoin Wallet

Ok, sure. :)

> You are the only one who can control and have access to your wallet.

That's a claim of being non-custodial?

> If your e-mail gets compromised, only you can access your Bitcoin India
  wallet, because you would still have 2fa on your phone at Google
  Authenticator.

If the email is relevant for your security, somebody can grant you access and
that somebody ... has access. That does not sound non-custodial.

> All transactions are synced across all of your devices in real time and are
  protected by an intense bank-level security protocol.

Now if we would give them the benefit of the doubt and assume you restored the
same seed on all devices then yes, the blockchain would make sure of keeping
your devices in sync but somehow "protected by an intense bank-level security
protocol" does induce the opposite of trust.

Many reviews read like [this on Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitcoinindia.Btciapp&reviewId=gp%3AAOqpTOE83Fa_4e8yAHGLd4u4NXTsd_Tj8iJ-ZJDTJsibJFw987tNkwVz_mM3adWH9wvIvTN9--jTstHEgfo_NoY):

  Don’t install this app

At this point we assume the worst. At the very least it is a custodial offering
and thus **not verifiable** but ... don't install it. Just don't.
