### [Legal Information](https://www.yuh.com/en/support/faq)

>  Yuh is the result of a joint venture between two renowned Swiss financial institutions: Swissquote and PostFinance. Yuh itself is not a bank. The banking and financial services offered in the Yuh app are provided by Swissquote, which is authorised by FINMA, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority.

## Analysis 

Country restrictions for app installation and registration, plus the language barrier made this difficult for us to review. Moreover, the service has extensively complicated legal terminologies that are difficult to fathom. 

It has [separate legal agreements](https://www.yuh.com/en/legal) for separate portions of its service:

1. General Terms and Conditions for Yuh Accounts
2. Yuh Account Privacy Policy
3. Fractional Trading Agreement for Yuh Accounts
4. Best Execution Policy for Yuh Accounts
5. Safe Custody Regulations for Yuh Accounts
6. Exchanges Conditions for Yuh Accounts
7. Brochure on Risks Involved in Trading Financial Instruments
8. Digital Assets Contract for Yuh Accounts and Digital Assets Risk Disclosure
9. SQX Trading Rules
10. General Terms and Conditions for the use of Yuh Debit Cards
11. Third party remuneration
12. Note on outsourcing
13. Special Terms and Conditions for the use of eBill
14. Swissqoin Distribution Memorandum
15. Terms and Conditions of the Yuh App
16. Yuh App and Website Privacy Policy

The most pertinent for our purposes is the [Digital Assets Contract for Yuh Accounts and Digital Assets Risk Disclosure](https://links.imagerelay.com/cdn/2958/ql/digital-assets-contract-and-risk-disclosure-en-v2)

> D CUSTODY OF DIGITAL ASSETS
> 10. CUSTODY SERVICES
> 10.1. Digital Assets acquired through the System or Transferred to Bank DLAs may be kept by us in custody (a) either directly, or (b) with a third party custodian, depositary or professional service provider (each a “Sub-custodian”) in our name, acting as nominee (fiduciary), but for your account and at your own risk. We select Sub-custodians at our sole discretion. Upon written request, we will provide a list of criteria we use to identify suitable Sub-custodians.
>
> You acknowledge that, unless otherwise indicated by us, we determine at our sole discretion whether the Digital Assets are kept in custody directly by us or by a Subcustodian. A substantial part, and potentially all, Digital Assets may therefore be held with a Sub-custodian. All Digital Assets credited from time to time to your Yuh Account will be held by us solely as nominee on your behalf. You remain the legal and beneficial owner of such Digital Assets

and 

> 12.1. We do not undertake to offer custody services for the Digital Assets during the entire duration of the Digital Assets. In case we discontinue or are unable to continue offering custody services for the Digital Assets, for whatever reason, we may prevent, condition or delay any Transfer of the Digital Assets if we deem it necessary or appropriate for our own protection... 

## Verdict 

As the contract stipulates, 

> All Digital Assets credited from time to time to your Yuh Account will be held by us solely as nominee on your behalf. 

and...

> ...we may prevent, condition or delay any Transfer of the Digital Assets if we deem it necessary or appropriate for our own protection...

Initially, we took all this information and determined that the service is a custodial one. However, we verified with the provider on twitter and they confirmed that their wallets cannot send and receive.
