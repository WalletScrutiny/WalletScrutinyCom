## Analysis

- ☑️ Supports Bitcoin
- ☑️ [Can withdraw/deposit Bitcoin](https://nanovest.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19621006280089-How-do-I-withdraw-crypto-assets-on-nanovest)
- The user is not in charge of the assets. [Under __Deposits and Withdrawals Crypto Asset__:](https://www.nanovest.io/en/terms-conditions/)

> [...] Nanovest securely stores all Crypto Asset private keys in its control in a combination of online and offline storage [...]


## Other Observations

This Indonesian app claims to have a crypto wallet for easy deposit and withdrawal, however cryptocurrency is not its main focus. Instead it claims advertises itself as a "gateway to global investing" and appears to have the features of a standard exchange. 

As seen in the Terms and Conditions, Nanoverse is capable of terminating the users' account.

Since the control of the private keys reside with the provider, this is a **custodial** service.
