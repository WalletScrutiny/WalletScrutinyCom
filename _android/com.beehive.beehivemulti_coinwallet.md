>
> - Shared (Proportional) Staking Pools
- Shared (Proportional) Masternodes
- Low listing fee
- Low outgoing fee (0.5%)
- Layers of Security for all assets
- Quick sign in + Added Optional 2FA for extra security
- 24 Hour Support
>
> Think about a Beehive. Each pod of honey, secured by its own layer of walls, and guards to protect the entire thing. All the while, working to enhance the community and spread natural diversity.
