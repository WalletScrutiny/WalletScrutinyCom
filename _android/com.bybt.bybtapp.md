**Update 2022-01-04**: The new app coinglass does not have a bitcoin wallet and seems to have a general cryptocurrency information dashboard with cryptocurrency prices and charts.

**Update 2022-01-03**: It appears that bybt has rebranded to Coinglass. Bybt.com redirects to coinglass.com. The android app for bybt now points to a 404. The iOS app is now named coinglass. This app may need a **new review** for the new Android app with appID 'com.coinglass.android'


**Update 2021-11-03**: This app is not available anymore.

## Updated Review 2021-10-29

The similarity with Bybit both in name and logo is highly suspicious given that this app does not have much functionality. That is the definition of **"Fake"**. An app, that mimics logo and name, and falls short of the features of the original app. 

Bybt describes itself as a

> Cryptocurrency Futures Trading & information platform

We were not able to access any trading feature. 

## Old Review 2021-10-19

**⚠️ Warning**: The app's logo and name bears a resemblance with another app.

## App Description

Bybt is, in its own words:

>  a cryptocurrency futures trading & information platform

It doesn't give much more information other than that. The website is meant to be a real-time market overview, and so is the app. There's no option to buy or trade BTC.

Furthermore, we see a disclaimer in the [Bybt User Agreement.](https://www.bybt.com/Disclaimer)
