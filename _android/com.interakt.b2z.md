## App Description

B2Z Wallet markets itself first and foremost as an app for buying and selling crypto.

> Buy and promote crypto immediately for your mobile. Easy account top-up together along with your credit score card. Gain excessive hobby for your budget with the B2Z Earn feature. Join one of the world's quickest buying and selling structures and control your portfolio at the go.

There's not much on "storing" bitcoin or self-custody. However on the website there is an option to receive cryptocurrency OTC or through depositing crypto or fiat "with the payment option of your choice."
