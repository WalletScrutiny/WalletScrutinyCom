## Analysis 

They claim to be decentralized: 

> Decentralized SuperWallet is integrated, and the private key is encrypted and stored on the user device. Not affected by code security, politics and other factors

This multiwallet exchange also promises 'NO KYC':

> Wallet authorized transactions, no registration, no KYC, transaction settlements are completed on the chain, can not be tampered with, safe and transparent

Despite all these claims, the app does not provide a way to backup the wallet using seed phrases. The restrictive clauses of their Terms and Conditions also indicate that this really is a **custodial** service.
