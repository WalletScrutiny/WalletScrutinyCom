## Analysis 

- This is a cryptocurrency exchange based in the Philippines
- The website listed in developer contact is offline
- The app issues an error after showing the splash logo:

> Notification
>
> System is being checked. For more information, please visit the Bexpress Pro homepage. 

- We messaged them on twitter, FB messenger and via sms, and await their response. 
- Although there was no official announcement or notice, the offline website, the non-working app and the 2 years of not-updating the app lend us to ascertain this app to be **defunct**
