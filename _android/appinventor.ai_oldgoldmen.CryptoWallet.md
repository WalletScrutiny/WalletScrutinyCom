This app has a rather special description that looks more like a dictionary so
I'm not 100% sure if they claim the app to have those features but lets assume
they do:

> Cryptowallet<br><br>
  A multicryptocurrency wallet is a device, physical medium, program or a
  service which stores the public and/or private keys and can be used to track
  ownership, receive or spend cryptocurrencies.

and

> A mnemonic sentence is considered secure. The BIP-39 standard creates a 512
  bit seed from any given mnemonic. The set of possible wallets is 2. Every
  passphrase leads to a valid wallet. If the wallet was not previously used it
  will be empty.

So it is a BIP39 (self custodial) Bitcoin wallet.

This app has no website with further claims or a link to source code.

The only two reviews are:

  ★★★★★ 3 June 2020<br>
  Best and excellent app to download. Only this app. Rush and download

and

> Ricardo Davila<br>
  ★☆☆☆☆ 14 March 2021<br>
  Tried to deposit some coins and so far nothing has come through even though
  it's already confirmed on the blockchain... Careful might be a scam

I tend to trust Ricardo more than Frank or the provider in this case and suggest
to **not trust this app** without further investigations.

Without further information we have to file it as closed source and therefore
**not verifiable**.
