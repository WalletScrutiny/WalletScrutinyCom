We tried the app, and also ran into this same problem making it **impossible to use the app.** We posted the screenshot [on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1463338329512972293)

The app was launched on April 9, 2021 and has not been updated since. Going by the date of the early Play Store reviews talking about this issue, it looks as though there has not been any update to fix this issue.
