**Update 2022-01-04**: This app is now available on the Play Store again. [(Twitter Screenshot)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1478325587693359105)

**Update 2021-09-06**: This app is not on Play Store anymore.

{{ page.title }} is the companion app to
{% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/jubiterblade' verdict='true' %} but
also a "software wallet":

> JuBiter wallet 2.0 is not only the official companion to JuBiter Blade - the
  cryptocurrency hardware wallet produced by JuBiter, but also a feature-rich
  cryptocurrency software wallet.

This means you can use it as a wallet without the hardware wallet.

> Security:
> 
> - Local private key generation and storage with encryption of userâ€™s PIN.

This means they claim it's self-custodial but absent public source code it is
**not verifiable**.
