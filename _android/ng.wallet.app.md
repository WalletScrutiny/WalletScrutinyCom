**UPDATED 2021-09-01** This app does not actually provide services for crpytocurrency trading. Also in the FAQs, accounts are funded 

> via bank transfer and your bank card

This app **does not appear to support BTC.**

Wallets Africa is quite a broad product, the lack of source code makes it
impossible to verify this app and there are no statements on their website as to
management of private keys.

Our verdict: This “wallet” is probably custodial and therefore is
**not verifiable**.
