## Update 2024-07-20

A search for the app ID "com.kryptogo.walletapp" turns up some potential android repository - but nothing conclusive. One such hit is for the repository called ["kg_sdk_example"](https://github.com/kryptogo/kg_sdk_example). This comes with an *android_example* folder and a build.gradle.kts file but no build instructions, no tags, branches or documentation that would match up with the Google Play version. 

We filed an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/kryptogo/kg_sdk_example/issues/1) and posted on [X.](https://x.com/dannybuntu/status/1814586277431550449)

## Review 2023-04-28

**Note:** The app has three related domains on its developer contacts. 

- stickey.app
- stickeygo.com
- kryptogo.com

## App Description from Google Play 

> KryptoGO Wallet is a non-custodial wallet, which allows you and nobody else full control over your assets.

## Analysis 

We downloaded and [installed the app](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1651859617209810944).

- Seed phrases were provided
- There is a Bitcoin wallet that can send and receive 
- We were not able to locate the specific repository for the Android app. 

We messaged them on twitter but for the meanwhile, we'll tag this as having **no publicly available source.**
