## Analysis 

We were not able to install this app. Here are some interesting things about this app: 

### [Terms](https://quasarwallet.com/documents/terms-en.pdf) 

It defines terms as such:

> “Deposit”: means the operation of inflow of cash on the account held at the custodian bank Banco di Napoli
Intesa San Paolo, branch in Corso Mazzini, Cosenza; 
> 
> "Crypto Wallet": means the software that allows the holding, safeguarding and management of cryptographic keys used to digitally sign cryptocurrency transactions for distributed ledgers (or Blockchain);
>
> Reflex Token SRL reserves the right to impose limitations on the account based on the information provided.
> 
> The Company will also have the right to suspend and / or interrupt the User or Customer's access to the Platform
in the following cases:

### Verdict 

If we go by the claims in its Google Play description that it can send and receive BTC, and if we analyze the terms and the amount of control the platform has over user accounts, then we can come to the conclusion that this is a **custodial** provider.
