## Analysis 

- The app was not available for installation for any of our devices.
- We searched GitHub Code for the app ID, but found [0 results](https://github.com/search?q=com.asymony.wallet&type=code).
- Despite efforts to install it, we failed as the next error indicated that the app was not available for our country. 
- We could work with these presumptions based on the description:
  - The app supports a BTC wallet
  - The app provides the private keys
  - The app does not make any claim regarding source-availability
  - The app does not have its app on GitHub. 
- The verdict we could come up with given the available information and presumptions is that this app is **not source-available.**
