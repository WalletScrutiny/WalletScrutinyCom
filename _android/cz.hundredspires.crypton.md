## Analysis 

- [Screenshot](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1668181926681915393)
- The app seems to be related to a WEXO token. There is an option to buy that token along with other cards such as:
- Purchasing Amantius Apartments
- Purchasing HODL Index 
- Purchasing KB / HODLX konto
- NFTs. 
- Purchasing the token, brings up an invoice page but no wallet address. 
- This app **does not provide a wallet for BTC**.
