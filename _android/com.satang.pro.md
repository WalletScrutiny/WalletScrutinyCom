## Analysis 

The Thailand based app looks like a bitcoin exchange. We installed the app and registered. The app required us to pass KYC prior to access to most of the app's features, including the wallets. 

We were able to find information about how the service stores the private keys in its [Terms and Conditions:](https://satangcorp.com/en/legal/terms)

> Satang securely stores all Digital Currency private keys in our control in a combination of online and offline storage. As a result, it may be necessary for Satang to retrieve certain information from offline storage in order to facilitate a Digital Currency Transaction in accordance with your instructions, which may delay the initiation or crediting of such Digital Currency Transaction for 48 hours or more. You acknowledge and agree that a Digital Currency Transaction facilitated by Satang may be delayed.  

This is a **custodial** service.
