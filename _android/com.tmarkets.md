       Not a good place to be and somewhere in Europe too. Not for UK. They are very good in taking out money from your account... But when it comes to pay back.... It's like never coming back. All marketing people will help u in first as long as taking money from you... After wards you don't see them and damn they don't respond. 👎👎👎

       They are insisting to you to make a deposit of 250 euro immediately which is for not trustworthy when a person on a phone continuously insists for your money.
