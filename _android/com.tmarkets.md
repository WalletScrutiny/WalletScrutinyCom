       Not a good place to be and somewhere in Europe too. Not for UK. They are very good in taking out money from your account... But when it comes to pay back.... It's like never coming back. All marketing people will help u in first as long as taking money from you... After wards you don't see them and damn they don't respond. ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž

       They are insisting to you to make a deposit of 250 euro immediately which is for not trustworthy when a person on a phone continuously insists for your money.

T1Markets is a financial service provider that offers forex and CFDs for online trading. The brand is authorized and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC). Bitcoin CFDs and other crypto CFDs are available for trading on the MT4 trading platform provided by T1Markets. Traders must understand how to trade Bitcoin CFDs before placing their trades. Bitcoin is paired with major fiat currencies such as BTCUSD, BTCEUR. If a trader believes that the price of Bitcoin will go up, he places a â€˜buyâ€™ order on the trading platform. But if he forecasts that the price will drop, he places a â€˜sellâ€™ order.

## Verdict

Sites/apps that allow users to trade in forex, derivatives and cryptocurrency CFDs **cannot send and receive bitcoins**.
