**Update 2024-06-26**

- The [Tags issue](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-wallet-mobile/issues/60), I will now try to build this app. 
 

**Update 2024-02-09**: This app is source-available but despite various comments
on the [open issue 60](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-wallet-mobile/issues/60)
there is no reaction from the provider.

Emanuel has identified
[this commit](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-wallet-mobile/commit/60113f49959b74e3e70e3be937240538bda38549)
as likely candidate for the current version `v0.9.0` on Google Play. Let's see
if we can compile it using the
[readme](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-wallet-mobile/blob/master/README.md)
and
[what it points to](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-wallet-mobile/wiki/Project-Setup#build-and-run)
...

```
$ git clone https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-wallet-mobile
$ cd komodo-wallet-mobile/
$ podman run -it --rm -v$PWD:/mnt --workdir=/mnt android:latest
root@44f18b8963e9:/mnt# git checkout 60113f49959b74e3e70e3be937240538bda38549

root@44f18b8963e9:/mnt# apt install jq curl coreutils
root@44f18b8963e9:/mnt# ./fetch_coins.sh 
root@44f18b8963e9:/mnt# git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git $HOME/flutter
root@44f18b8963e9:/mnt# export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/flutter/bin"

root@44f18b8963e9:/root/flutter# git fetch

root@44f18b8963e9:/root/flutter# cd /mnt/
root@44f18b8963e9:/mnt# flutter build apk
   Woah! You appear to be trying to run flutter as root.
   We strongly recommend running the flutter tool without superuser privileges.

and that's where we give up for now. The build instructions are geared towards
IDE integration, explaining how to build the project with Android Studio while
we need isolation in a docker container for example and automation via the
command line.
