**Update 2024-11-22:**

## Version Unavailable:  

We were testing the Komodo Wallet APK version 0.9.2, but the source code is currently not available. Despite opening an issue with the provider to request the source code, we have not received any response. As a result, we will mark the wallet as no source and revisit it once the source code is provided.

## Reproducibility

 The source code for this wallet contained a [README with instructions](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-wallet-mobile/wiki/Project-Setup#build-and-run) on how to verify and what dependencies were required, so using the information from these steps, we created a dockerfile for the use of our {% include testScript.html %}. 

 - [Dockerfile](https://gitlab.com/walletscrutiny/walletScrutinyCom/-/blob/81b1f718a4b07edc4c6e84c819eb72a12acf3e28/scripts/test/android/com.komodoplatform.atomicdex.dockerfile)
 - [Atomic Dex Build Script](https://gitlab.com/walletscrutiny/walletScrutinyCom/-/blob/81b1f718a4b07edc4c6e84c819eb72a12acf3e28/scripts/test/android/com.komodoplatform.atomicdex.sh)

 After the proper environment is set up, our script will generate an AAB (Android App Bundle) from which we can use *bundletool* to create APKs suitable for various device configurations and perform further verifications.

## App Description from Google Play

> AtomicDEX Mobile offers the widest permission-less cross-chain trading support of any mobile crypto app on the market.
>
> Itâ€™s a fast and secure multi-coin wallet with peer-to-peer (P2P) DEX support, designed for ease of use and perfect for storing digital assets.
>
> The app provides a secure and easy way to buy and store multiple cryptocurrencies. It supports dozens of blockchain protocols natively such as Bitcoin, BNB Chain, Ethereum, Polygon, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and many more.

## Analysis

- Once installed, we are informed that we are beta-testers.
- We created a wallet and were given a 12-word seed phrase. 
- There is a legacy BTC address with send and receive functions. 
- There in an option to back up the private keys.
- The developers [claim](https://atomicdex.io/en/blog/q1-2023-progress-report/#atomicdex-mobile-goes-100-open-source) they are 100% Open Source.
- We found the [repository](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-wallet-mobile) for the mobile app.
- This app is **[for verification](https://gitlab.com/walletscrutiny/walletScrutinyCom/-/issues/490)**.

## Build Information

Running our initial tests using test.sh on `com.komodoplatform.atomicdex_v105.apk`, the dockerfile above, and the com.komodoplatform.atomicdex script, we get the following results:

We could not consider the diffs of version 0.9.1 as benign as there are far too many differences. 
We [updated the relevant issue](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-wallet-mobile/issues/116#issuecomment-2266635605) in the repository of komodoplatform.atomicdex, and eagerly await their collaboration to make the build reproducible.
Version 0.9.1 of this app is **not-verifiable**
