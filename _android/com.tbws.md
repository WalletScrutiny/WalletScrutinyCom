## Analysis

- According to the [terms](https://theblackwallstreet.com/faq/terms-of-service/), illegal transactions can immediately be blocked with custody going to the provider.
- [Prime Trust](https://www.primetrust.com/use-cases/custodians) is a custodian.
- Once we have verified our number we were able to access the dashboard of the app.
- We initially see an 'Invest Now' button. We clicked it and the screen that followed, was a "Create custodial account and verify your identity" page.
- Another option was to "Create Savings Vault" - however, an error appeared when we chose this option:

> User has no custodial account.

- In the 'Settings' option, we are again, enjoined to "Setup a custodial account".
- There was no other way to set up a wallet except through setting up a custodial account. This makes it a **custodial** provider.
