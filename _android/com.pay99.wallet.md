This is the payment app for the ride sharing app "99" which is popular in
Brazil. 99 was bought by "Didi Chuxing", the Chinese Ride Sharing giant.

Their
[details on Bitcoin](https://99app.com/99pay/novo-app/bitcoin/) section is not
very explicit but for the lack of any inbound or outbound transactions being
mentioned, we have to assume this app is only for what they talk about a lot -
speculation on the price of bitcoin.
