> Okcoin is a secure crypto exchange that makes it easy to buy, sell, and hold your cryptocurrency with the lowest fees around.

Being an exchange hints to being custodial.

From [the official website](https://www.okcoin.com/security.html):

> With over 95% of your crypto in offline cold storage and a small fraction on multisig hot wallets, your funds are safe because they are inaccessible with a single key and need at least 3 to 5 signatures approved before they’re processed.

This probably means that this app is **custodial**, as OkCoin is in charge of your funds. Thus it's **not verifiable**.
