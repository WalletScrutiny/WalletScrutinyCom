## Analysis 

- [BitcoinTalk page](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5350823.0)
- [Eqifi token $EQX](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/eqifi/)
- While registering, both the app and website keeps giving an error: 

> Registration failed.

Without the ability to register, we can only go by the app description. As the description above states, the app is **custodial**. This is made more evident by the fact that not being able to register with the site, and hence login, disallows our access to a wallet (if any).

- To further validate our claims, we emailed: support@zendesk.eqifi.com, but the email bounced.
- We emailed again at: support@eqifi.com, and await their response.
