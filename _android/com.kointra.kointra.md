## Analysis 

### Terms 

> - 5.2.1 User savings are stored in environments independent of Platform servers against a possible cyber attack.
> - 5.2.2 Kointra has the right not to accept money transfers made by users without giving any reason. 
> - 5.2.3. Kointra will fulfill the transfer transactions made by the user as soon as possible. Kointra will not be liable for any damages that may arise if deposits and/or withdrawals are not carried out

We were not able to register due to their sms-verification requirements stating that our local phone number is not valid. 

We can glean the following:

- This is an exchange that can refuse to accept money from users **without giving any reason**. This means that they have control over the wallet.  
- A further example for this app's custodial nature is this phrase: *Kointra will fulfill the transfer transactions made by the user as soon as possible. Kointra will not be liable for any damages that may arise if deposits and/or withdrawals are not carried out.*

Without registering and testing the plaform itself, and only verifying information found via its own description: we have a strong reason to believe that this is a **custodial** provider.
