**Update:** The app is not available on Google Play anymore.

This app claims to be "Non-Custodial" as their main key feature but is it open
source?

We find no such claim and while the company has a 
[GitHub](https://github.com/ChainZilla), the app's source code
[cannot be found](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AChainZilla+%22com.chameleon.wallet%22&type=Code)
there. This wallet is therefore **not verifiable**.
