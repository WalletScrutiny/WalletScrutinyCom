## Analysis

- We registered, but received an [error](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1681128714866753536) after inputting a 4-digit pin:

> Server maintenance mode is enabled, please try again later.

- We were not able to inspect the app's features beyond that point. 
- If we were to assume that all the provider's claims are true, then the 'Services' section of the [terms](https://tarality.online/terms-and-conditions/) would prevail:
    - The app generates the private keys, and they have no access to it. This makes it self-custodial.
- We were not able to find any claims regarding source-availability. 
- There were [0 results](https://github.com/search?q=com.taralwallet&type=code) when we searched for the app ID, on GitHub Code.
- Since this app was very recently updated, we couldn't mark it as defunct. For now, the app is **not source-available.**
