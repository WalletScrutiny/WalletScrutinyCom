## [Privacy Policy](https://tatspace.com/privacy.html)

> Wallet Information: When you create a Block chain Wallet through our Services, you will generate a public and private key pair and when you log out of the Wallet, **we collect an encrypted file that, if it is unencrypted, would contain these keys**, as well as your transaction history. When you allow notifications through your Account Settings, we will collect the unencrypted public key in order to provide such notifications. We do not collect an unencrypted private key from you neither do we decrypt any Wallet file data.
>
> Transaction Information: We may collect and keep information relating to transactions you carry out in your Wallet that change one virtual currency to another.

## Analysis 

We downloaded the app, [(Screenshots)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1645994440518160384) and registered with the service. Like most account based wallet providers, there was no option to backup or restore the wallet using the private keys. 

As stated in the privacy policy, {{ page.title }}: **we collect an encrypted file that, if it is unencrypted, would contain these keys**. This is a custodial operation, and thus, the app is **not verifiable**.
