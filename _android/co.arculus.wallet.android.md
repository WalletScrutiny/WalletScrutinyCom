>
> Your Arculus wallet solution is made up of two parts that work together: a physical Arculus Key™ Card and the mobile Arculus Wallet™ App. The Arculus Key Card is a sleek, metal card with leading-edge embedded security technology, a CC EAL6+ Secure Element Hardware Classification, to securely store your crypto and NFT keys. The card can be purchased at the Arculus website – getarculus.com.

## Analysis 

This is the companion app to {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/arculus' verdict='true' %}. We tried installing it, but it required the NFC card before proceeding. 

Without the functionality of a wallet absent the hardware component, this **cannot be described as a wallet**. 

It can only be described as a companion app.
