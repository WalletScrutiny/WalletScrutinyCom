## App Description from Google Play

> The Bitcoin Hack app is an intuitive software that grants unlimited access to the Bitcoin and crypto markets. It takes advantage of an advanced algorithm that uses historical price data and technical indicators to analyze the crypto markets. Once the app has analyzed the markets, it provides in-depth insights into the market conditions. We designed the Bitcoin Hack app to be intuitive, enabling traders of all skill levels to use it with ease.

## Analysis

- The privacy policy's domain is bitcoinhack.info.
- Although it is not linked from the Google Play page, another possible website for this app is bitcoin-hack.com.
- App registration emails us from a different entity named Elland Road. Clicking "Enter account" in the email verification opens up a login page in the URL ellandroadcapital.com.
- A second email is then sent. A payment page is then opened. It has Visa/Mastercard and CryptoPay as choices for the payment options. The lowest amount the user can pay is $250 USD.
- We took a look at the website's terms:

> Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, by registering on the Website and receiving approval from us, you can obtain, or attempt to obtain, for a fee or for no fee, the Subscription Services. The Subscription Services will provide you with e-mail content, text and other materials (“Subscription Content”) relevant to online marketing provided by us and third party partners (“Third Party Providers”).

- At this point, we have to cease proceeding with the review as this is evidently **not a wallet**.
