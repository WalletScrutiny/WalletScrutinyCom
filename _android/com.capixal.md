## Analysis 

- We tried to access the website, but it merely gave an error: 

> We do not provide services in your country. 

- However, when we tried to use TOR, and VPN with servers in Netherlands, US and Japan - all of these options showed the same error. 
- We accessed the site via [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20220314164619/https://www.capixal.com/) and was able to see the site contents. 
- The app traded in Bitcoin CFDs with the motto: 

> Expand your trading horizons with Bitcoin CFDs
- One can find the [withdrawal and fee rates on this](https://web.archive.org/web/20220401205155/https://capixal-fo-content.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Content/Documents/costs_and_charges.pdf) archived version of the site.

- With CFDs, this app cannot **send/receive bitcoins**.
