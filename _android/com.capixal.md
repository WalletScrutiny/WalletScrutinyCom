- However, when we tried to use TOR, and VPN with servers in Netherlands, US and Japan - all of these options showed the same error. 
- We accessed the site via [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20220314164619/https://www.capixal.com/) and was able to see the site contents. 
- The app traded in Bitcoin CFDs with the motto: 

> Expand your trading horizons with Bitcoin CFDs
