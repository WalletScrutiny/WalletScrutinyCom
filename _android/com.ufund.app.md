## Analysis 

- We registered with the app using our Google sign-in. 
- We found what appears to be the "wallet", but it did not have a QR code and no BTC address was provided. We asked them on [twitter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1666357448704397312) about this. 
- Subsequently, since we did not find a BTC address that is generated, we also did not find any options to backup the private keys. 
- We also emailed their developer contact: info@ufund.online
- We're sort of in a quandary, since the app is meant to have a wallet, but in our case doesn't. It could be in the verge of folding up. It could be a bug. Or it could be that the app's functions aren't 100% provided to us. Nevertheless, while we wait for their reply, we'll mark this app as a **work-in-progress**.
