## Analysis 

Currently, the BTC deposit/withdraw functions are marked with 'Suspension' on our newly created account. This tells us that the platform has a level of control over the user's account. There are no private keys provided in the service which makes it very likely that this is a **custodial** service and thus, **not-verifiable**.
