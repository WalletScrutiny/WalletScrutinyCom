According to
[the words of its owner on 2020-04-12](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/g04ece/bitcoincom_wallet_app_is_still_closed_source/fn7rlvy/)
this wallet is closed source until further notice. There is no indication that this will be changing, and the repository's updates ended at the 5.4-hotfix. We assume it is still supposed to be non-custodial but without source code, this is **not verifiable**.
