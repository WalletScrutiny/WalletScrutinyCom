## App Description from Google Play 

> This app includes bitcoind and bitcoin-cli compiled for Android. All command line and config options are available to the user. There is an option to auto-start the daemon when device is charging and on WiFi.
>
> Run it for fun, or to help me experiment with NAT traversal and other new capabilities. Please do not rely on this app to serve your wallet or you might lose all your funds.
>
> The app is open source. 

## Analysis

> built as a testing environment for NAT traversal capability

And therefore not primarily a wallet.
