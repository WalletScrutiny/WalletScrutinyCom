## App Description

This app is meant for trading stocks as well as buying and selling cryptocurrencies:

> The all-in-one TradeStation mobile app gives you the tools to trade the way you want right in the palm of your hands. Trade stocks, ETFs, options, futures, and crypto all in a single trading app.

TradeStation is owned by TradeStation Group, Inc.

## The Site

In the [FAQs Page](https://www.tradestation.com/faqs/#et_pb_tab_2), TradeStation says that it is not an exchange but a brokerage service:

> **As a broker, TradeStation Crypto is not bound to a single exchange and has the flexibility to provide access across multiple liquidity sources.**

Additionally, TradeStation asserts that it is not a bitcoin wallet.

> We’ve engaged BitGo to implement a multi-signature wallet structure that leverages dual-system controls, address whitelisting, spending limits and multiple wallets. **We believe that custody is best left to firms like BitGo**, whose sole responsibility is to provide a wallet solution for crypto assets.

## Verdict

While TradeStation has engaged with *BitGo* to provide wallet services, a third-party service is still in charge of your assets. As such, this app will still be marked as **custodial** and thus it is **not verifiable.**.
