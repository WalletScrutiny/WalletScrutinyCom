## Analysis 

- The provider's website is no longer online. 
- When we installed the app, it only showed the splash logo and then opened a browser with an error: 

> Webpage not available
> 
> The webpage at https://mobile.bitsmoey.co.com could not be loaded 
because:
>
> net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED 

- We emailed the provider about the status of the app at wallet@bitsmoney.co.com but expect it to bounce.
- Despite claims of being "Open Source", the [archived version](https://web.archive.org/web/20220106100315/https://bitsmoney.co.com/) of the website does not list a GitHub repository
- With only those contact options, and a non-functioning app, we believe this app is already **defunct**
