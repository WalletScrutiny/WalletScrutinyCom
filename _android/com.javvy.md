## Analysis 

- The app was last updated in 2019 
- We tried running the app on BlueStacks 5 Android 7, but the circle status just kept on spinning.
- The app cannot be installed on our mobile device with Android 12
- We emailed them at info@inanomo.com but the email was promptly returned. 
- They have a [support page](https://support.javvy.com/), but the latest post was made 2 years ago.
- The contact form is no longer working and the twitter account [@javvycrypto](https://twitter.com/javvycrypto) has been suspended.
- We emailed the CEO as well, but we believe that this app is on the verge or, is already **defunct**. The providers held an ICO, but the token was not listed and is considered a [dead coin](https://www.coinopsy.com/dead-coins/javvy/).
