## Update 2024-07-16

No change regarding source availability is found.

## App Description 2021-11-10

> It is the first official digital wallet from Tokoin where you can store and transfer your TOKO token. Besides TOKO, you can also manage multiple cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum.

## The App

Downloaded the app and was asked for email, password, phone, sms verification. Then go to Settings > Wallets. You'll see 'Master Wallet' plus a 12-word mnemonics. Account verification is accomplished by submitting an identity document. It is possible to send and receive BTC. Wallet backups are also available with 12-word mnemonics.

## Verdict

Evidently, this is a **self-custodial** app. However we could not find a link to the source code on their website and a search for its Google Play appID 'com.tokoin.wallet' on GitHub, [did not lead to any repository containing code for the app](https://github.com/search?q=com.tokoin.wallet&type=code). Thus, this app **cannot be verified**.
