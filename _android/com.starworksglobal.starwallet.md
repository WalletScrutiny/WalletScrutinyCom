## App Description from Google Play

  > StarWALLET 3.0 "The All-In-One Super App"
  >
  > Manage Your Rewards and Digital Assets in a Single App!

## Analysis 

- The apps' Terms and Conditions could be found in the app. 
- We were not able to receive the app's SMS OTP.
- It describes the app as an unhosted wallet and includes a release from liability if the user's private keys are lost to malicious actors.
- We searched for the app ID on GitHub Code, and found [2 results](https://github.com/search?q=com.starworksglobal.starwallet&type=code). Both are related to WalletScrutiny and does not include the code for the Android app.
- According to the [whitepaper](https://www.starworksglobal.com/assets/docs/starworks-whitepaper-v3.0.pdf), 
  > StarPoints are redeemable for StarX.
- StarX is an ERC20 token which is currently an untracked listing on [CoinMarketCap.](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/starx-token/)
- We do not find any reference to Bitcoin and will assume that this app **does not support Bitcoin** until more information is available. We'll email the provider at account@starworksglobal.com to verify.
