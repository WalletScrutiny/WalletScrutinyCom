## Information from the Website

> We store the vast majority of the assets in secure offline storage.

## Analysis 

- We registered with the service and found a legacy BTC address that can send, receive, sell, buy and swap. 
- No seed phrases were provided.
- Then we checked the settings and tapped on 'security'. It did not have provisions for backing up the private keys. 
- The app's website explicitly tells us that this service stores assets in offline storage, making the service, **custodial** and the app, **non-verifiable**.
