## App Description from Google Play 

> Erium wallet allows you to buy, sell and exchange your preferred cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and
Litecoin (LTC), among many others. 
>
> With Erium, now you don't have to provide your private keys to centralized wallets and exchanges that are vulnerable to hacks and
often result in huge losses. In addition to encrypting your private keys, it also encodes your transaction data on your device, ensuring
no unauthorized access to your cryptocurrencies. 

## Analysis 

- The app provided the seed phrases
- Users can select between Legacy BTC and SegWit
- There is a BTC wallet that can send/receive 
- We found **no references that Erium is source-available**.
