**Update 2022-01-28**: This app is not in store anymore.

From its Google Play description:

> Bibox, AI-enhanced digital asset exchange, is one of the world's best cryptocurrency exchanges now. Bibox provides token exchange, contracts, bonds and margin trading with high liquidity and market depth.

Our initial assessment indicates that this is a centralized exchange.

We downloaded the app and found that it is possible to send and receive BTC. However, you are not provided with the keys to the wallet. 

We emailed [Bibox support](support@bibox.zendesk.com) to further validate our findings. 

Until such time that new information arises, and with no mention of self-custody, it's presumable that this app is **custodial** and **not verifiable.**

We will update the verdict once they have replied.
