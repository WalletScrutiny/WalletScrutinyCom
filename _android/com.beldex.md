**Update 2021-11-16**: This app is not on Play Store anymore.

**Note:** It would appear that this app is still in its development stages.

## App Description

> Securely Buy, Sell & Store Bitcoin (BTC), Beldex (BDX), and other Cryptocurrencies.

> Buy and hodl Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, Monero, Beldex and many other crypto safely. We are an exchange regulated by the Financial Intelligence Unit of Estonia.

> With two-factor authentication, anti-spoofing protection, device approval, and withdrawal address white-labeling features,

## The Site

The Beldex has Windows, Linux, web and android versions available for download.

## The App

We were able to install the app however it took a long time to load. The desktop Linux package was named beldex-electron-wallet. Once the app has been installed, it allows for the creation of a wallet including the backup phrases. However, the currency that was available at the moment was only BDX, no Bitcoin wallet was available.

## Verdict

The app is still in its development stages and it **still has no bitcoin** support. Please [open an issue](https://gitlab.com/walletscrutiny/walletScrutinyCom/-/issues/new) if this verdict is outdated!
