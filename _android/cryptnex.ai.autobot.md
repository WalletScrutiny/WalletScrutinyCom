## Analysis

- The developer website is no longer online. 
- There is no archive entry for the website 
- We installed the app, but the registration page just shows a circle that kept circling. We tested on BlueStacks 5 Android 9
- Both the terms and privacy policy page come up blank, with an upside down icon of Android.
- We emailed the developer at hi@cryptnex.ai, but the email was promptly bounced. 
- Based on these findings and on the description, we give this app a verdict of **not a wallet**, and **defunct** until further information is available.
