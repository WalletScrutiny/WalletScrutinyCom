## Updated Review 2021-11-23

We were able to [download and install the app](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1463040174753923074).

Its Google Play appID has the word 'Bitmex', which is the name of a well-known cryptocurrency exchange. 

{% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.bitmex.mobile.android' verdict='true' %}

The reason for the similarity is not because it's fake, but because it's a [referral app](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1463041078295031810). One of the options when you open the app, is for the user to sign up to BitMex. Apart from the cryptocurrency prices and the referral, **it does not have a Bitcoin wallet.**

### Old Review 2021-10-21

This app is currently absent from the Play Store.
