This app is obsolete and there are some scam allegations. We did not download this app, as it was meant for an older version of Android.   

## App Description from Google Play 

> *Particl Copay Wallet is an open-source fork of BitPay’s Copay Wallet.

       Deposited 5 euro and 1.2 taken out as fee. So 3.8 left euro. Tried to send it back and BUM not enough amount to cover "transaction fee"....It is looks like a scam... They got your money now time for reason why you can't get it back. I understand fees etc... Wallet not a bank... 1.2 fee on 5 euro is a lot. And then you can't take it out becasue 3.8 is not enough to pay costs??!!! It should say before you deposit that you want be able to take it out... I am not going to put more money into it.

       Tried transfering 60 bucks a few months back, worth $200 now, from copay to particl copay (they are not the same company), just showed an error and they took the money. Contacted multiple times and even directly, still no reply.
