## Analysis 

- [Screenshots](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1656176836983013376)
- We downloaded the app and tested it. 
- During wallet creation we encountered an error "JSON parse error. Unrecognized Token", but was able to proceed by skipping.
- Skipping through wallet creation brings us to the default interface. 
- The default interface had an ETH wallet. 
- There is an option to "Add Token", where the user can input a ticker symbol or coin name. When we tried to enter 'BTC', it issued the same error "JSON parse error. Unrecognized Token"
- We were **not able to find evidence that this app supports BTC**.
