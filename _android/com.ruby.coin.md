The perfect choice for all conservative investors! With Ruby coin, you also enjoy concentrated liquidity.

## Analysis 

- We were not able to register because the app did not allow it.
- The last content on its page points to a recently concluded token sale.
- Its social media account last posted on [December 2022.](https://twitter.com/RubyCoinDAO/status/1605182422026686464)
- In its [terms and conditions](https://rubycointrade.com/terms-conditions/), it is stated that users must purchase a subscription in order to access the site's services.
- From the Google Play description, the only thing we could conclude is that it supports BTC, even though it refers to it as a 'token.' 
- We did not find any documentation indicating how it handles the private keys. 
- Thus, we make the conclusion that this is a **custodial** app. Moreover, we do not see this project as currently operating, making this **defunct.**
