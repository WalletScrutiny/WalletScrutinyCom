> Gridlock is the easiest way to securely store cryptocurrencies and realize the potential of blockchain technology. Gridlock is not only more secure than other cryptocurrency wallets, but it also gives you complete control over your crypto.
> 
> Don’t risk losing everything with centralized storage, and don’t deal with the headache of personal management. We believe top-notch security should never come at the price of privacy. Get the best of both worlds. Gridlock provides the platform and secure open-source tools to give you full control and ultimate protection over your assets.

This wallet offers support for multi-cryptocurrencies and claims to use [distributed key generation](https://docs.gridlock.network/the-tech/distributed-key-generation) "so no single node can access your full key."
> NO SEED PHRASE <br />
Our minds are swamped with passwords, passcodes, and pin numbers. Gridlock’s revolutionary recovery process uses social verification to eliminate the need for another pesky seed phrase to remember.
