## App Description from Google Play 

> Predict if the value of the former currency (of the pair chosen) will dip or rise in the future against the latter currency. For example, if the user selects INR/EUR as the pair. Now, he/she would be required to predict if the value of INR, against USD, will rise or dip in the future.

## Analysis 

- The listed website is no longer online 
- The app gives an error whenever we tried to register, login or chose the "forgot password" option. 
- With the website no longer online, and a non-functioning app, these are good indicators for this app's status of **defunct.**
