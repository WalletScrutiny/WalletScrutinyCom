This app seems to have replaced {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.tideisun.tidepay' verdict='true' %} with its iPhone counterpart: {% include walletLink.html wallet='iphone/com.tideisun.tidepay' verdict='true' %}

It has removed language that indicated custodianship, such as:

> User can top up USDT, BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, PAX, etc. from iSunOne wallet to card in real time

## App Description from Google Play

> The iSunOne Global Visa Card is a rechargeable prepaid card that allows top-ups of up to 50,000 USD. 
>
> ...utilize digital currency on both the Ethereum and Tron networks...

## Analysis 

Registration required a lot of [documents](https://www.isun1.com/documents) so we were not able to fully able to access all of its features.

From this [image](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/cZkFDfGGJsaXekA1GKyZYHKXL4mmVE7XlCANpvUbRoAVOY_9uzhS_WdD1YmqfBIQYg0=w2560-h1440) on its Google Play page, we can see that it handles USDT and USDC.

> (a) Stored Digital Asset: hosted digital asset wallet by iSunOne that allows you to store with iSunOne, the types of digital asset that have been approved by iSunOne for storage, a list of which is available in the iSunOne App.

Only USDC and USDT are mentioned. 

It mentions in its ["OTC Desk"](https://www.isun1.com/otci), that it supports: 

> Buy and sell USDT, USDC, BTC, ETH

We do not see any proof that the app itself supports a Bitcoin wallet. Rather, it [encourages users to download](https://www.isun1.com/faq?questionId=4764fca2-ab21-4449-9383-5e10bb6d07d9&appDefId=14c92d28-031e-7910-c9a8-a670011e062d) third-party wallets. In sending or receiving digital assets, it only [refers to USDC and USDT](https://www.isun1.com/faq?questionId=416f363e-648f-45bd-b9b8-5fe4ca8afdee&appDefId=14c92d28-031e-7910-c9a8-a670011e062d).

Among other things, they [recommend the use](https://www.isun1.com/post/btc-safety-3) of bitaddress.org.

This app **does not support Bitcoin**.
