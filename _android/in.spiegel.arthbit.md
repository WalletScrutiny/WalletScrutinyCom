## Analysis 

- This looks like a centralized exchange with a BTC/INR trading pair.
- The app provides a wallet to the user. This wallet is subject to controls and restrictions.
- During registration, only two countries were listed: India and UAE.
- The wallets are only available after KYC. 

### [Terms](https://arthbit.com/terms) 

- User accounts may be subject to suspension or termination for any or no reason
- Arthbit may share user information to law enforcement authorities. 

We were not able to register with the service, but the facts stated above are enough to give the app a verdict of *custodial* and thus **not-verifiable**.
