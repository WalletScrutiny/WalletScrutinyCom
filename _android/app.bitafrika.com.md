## Analysis

It stated in the description that it is a service for buying and selling Bitcoin. Thus it is likely that this is a custodial service.

From the official site's [TOS:](https://bitafrika.com/tos)

> BitAfrika may, in its sole discretion, at any time and for any or no reason, suspend or terminate this Agreement with or without prior notice.
