> Marketplace for Manufacturers, Farmers, Suppliers, Wholesalers, Retailers, Buyers and Consumers using unbreakable Smart Contracts and Trustless Escrow.

## Analysis 

- The listed website haladinar.io is no longer online. The domain is for sale.
- The app has a token HDN which is not listed in Coinmarketcap.com.
- The app requires that screen lock is enabled thus not enabling installation on BlueStacks 5.
- Once we installed the app, it provided the mnemonic phrases to create the wallet. But then, it just kept closing in an Android Emulator API 27.
- [Screenshots](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1661920798993514496)
- Assuming the app description is accurate and it does support BTC, can send and receive BTC, and the private key is provided, it still does not thoroughly provide its source code. Its existing [GitHub repository](https://github.com/haladinar) is bare with no commits and no Android app listed. This makes the app **source-unavailable**. But based on experience, though the app is downloadable, it is barely functioning, thus it can also be *defunct*.
