## Analysis 

- Despite the app name and Google Play description, we were **not able to find a Bitcoin wallet**. This is a [screenshot](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1696715546753171578) of the available networks for the app. We took a [video](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1696719368510677464) and reached out to the provider.

We would welcome any input from the provider in the event that we are mistaken.
