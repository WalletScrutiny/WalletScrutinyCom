## Analysis 

- Tutorial on [how to deposit/withdraw cryptocurrencies.](https://info.8v.com/hc/en-001/articles/4409485729049-Crypto-Deposit-Withdrawal)
- The website [describes](https://8v.com/aboutus) using both hot and **cold wallet** technology.
- The use of cold-wallets signifies that the provider holds the private keys to the user's wallets. Since this is a centralized exchange which provides user accounts with multiple-wallets, this means that the provider is **custodial** and the app, is **non-verifiable.**
