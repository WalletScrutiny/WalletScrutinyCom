## Analysis

In the [terms](https://www.bitstore.net/en/terms-of-use/), it is mentioned that funds are managed through an "Account". Thus, in another clause: *"The Customer agrees that their access to the Account may be revoked at any time if it involves activities contrary to the Company's business."*
