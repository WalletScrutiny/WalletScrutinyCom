**Update 2022-01-25**: This app is not in store anymore.

Given its app ID `com.polispay.copay` this app appears to be a clone of
{% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.bitpay.wallet' verdict='true' %}
which used to be called "Copay".

In the app's description we read:

> A unique wallet based on mnemonic phrases and public and private extended keys
> PolisPay wallet is impossible to hack.

which sounds like a claim to be non-custodial. Let's see if there is source code
somewhere ... nope. No mention of its source code or a repository.

This app is **not verifiable**.
