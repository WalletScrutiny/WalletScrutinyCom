## Update 2024-10-22

Our [test script](/scripts/test/android/com.foundationdevices.envoy.sh) was executed successfully, resulting in a successfully built APK.

The APK was built successfully:

```
âœ“ Built build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk .
```

We then extracted the generated APK from the build and also obtained the official APK from the Google Play Store. After unzipping both APKs using `unzip --qqd`, we performed a comparison using:

```
diff --recursive fromBuild/ fromOfficial/
```

The comparison revealed significant differences between the generated APK and the Play Store version:

There were around 1000+ more lines of diff containing png, webp and xml changes. With these many differences, the wallet is **not verifiable**.


**Conclusion:** Although the Docker image for the Envoy Wallet built successfully, the APK was not generated correctly. As a result, the APK is **not verifiable** at this time.

## App Description from Google Play

> Envoy is a simple Bitcoin wallet with powerful account management and privacy features.
>
> Use Envoy alongside your Passport hardware wallet for setup, firmware updates, and more.
>
> Envoy offers the following features:
>
> 1. Magic Backups. Get up and running with self-custody in only 60 seconds with automatic encrypted backups. Seed words optional.
>
> 2. Manage your mobile wallet and Passport hardware wallet accounts in the same app.
>
> 3. Send and receive Bitcoin in a zen-like interface.
>
> 4. Connect your Passport hardware wallet for setup, firmware updates, and support videos. Use Envoy as your software wallet connected to your Passport.
>
> 5. Fully open source and privacy preserving. Envoy optionally connects to the Internet with Tor for maximum privacy.
>
> 6. Optionally connect your own Bitcoin node.

A blog post states that this is not an ordinary "companion app", it is a fully-capable standalone self-custodial bitcoin wallet.
