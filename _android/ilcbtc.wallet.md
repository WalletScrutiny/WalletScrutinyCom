The description talking about

> * No Blockchain Download, Install and Run in Seconds

at least suggests that the target audience knows a lot about Bitcoin but there
is no word about being your own bank ...

The linked website is some alt-coin project website with a link back to the
Play Store wallet.

They link to [this GitHub](https://github.com/ILCoinDevTeam) where there is
nothing about an Android wallet.

[GitHub search](https://github.com/search?p=1&q=%22ilcbtc.wallet%22&type=Code)
is neither helpful.

As not even an implicit promise is indicating the contrary we assume the wallet
is custodial and conclude with the verdict: **not verifiable**.
