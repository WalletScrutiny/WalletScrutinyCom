## Analysis 

- Section 1.2 of the terms describes the service as the provision of "hosted wallets" to the user. 
- The definition of a "[hosted wallet](https://ciphertrace.com/glossary/wallet-hosted/#:~:text=In%20their%20Interpretive%20Letter%20%231172,receive%2C%20store%2C%20and%20transmit%20cryptocurrency)" according to an interpretative letter #1172: 
  > The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) defines a hosted wallet as “an account-based software program for storing cryptographic keys controlled by an identifiable third party. These parties receive, store, and transmit cryptocurrency transactions on behalf of their accountholders; the account holder generally does not have access to the cryptographic keys themselves.” Thus, users consequently do not have direct control over their funds.

In other terminologies, it is a **custodial** provider, with a **non-verifiable** app.
