- We were able to register but due to a bug in the app, we cannot sign in. The password field requires: uppercase, lowercase, number and symbol. When we tried to input a symbol - the app wouldn't allow any other symbol except an '@' sign. 
- When we tried to login, we were confused at first, because it asked for a passphrase, instead of the password which we originally entered. We typed in the 12-word mnemonic and successfully logged in.
- There is a BTC wallet that can send/receive. 
- The app is **not source-available** even though they have an organizational [GitHub repository](https://github.com/liocoin/liocoin001), which is barely updated.
