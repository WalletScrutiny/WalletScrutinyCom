## Analysis 

- We successfully downloaded and registered with the app. 
- We found a Bitcoin wallet that can send and receive with QR code and a public key. 
- The terms and conditions page was blank 
- We were not able to find the private keys or options to backup/restore the wallet.

## Verdict 

As a service that allows users to connect their banking account, with the option to buy/sell Bitcoin, with a Bitcoin wallet, the app lacks private key backup and restoration features. It performs KYC on its users. As of April 15, 2023, We were also not able to see a copy of user Terms and Conditions. This is a **custodial** app and therefore, it is **not verifiable**.
