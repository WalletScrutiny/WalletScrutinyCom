## App Description from Google Play 

> With the GetCoins Wallet, your private keys and your money remain in your control at all times. And you're using code that's 100% open source for community testing and audits.

## Analysis 

- We successfully installed the app 
- It has a BTC wallet that can send/receive 
- Mnemonic backup was provided 
- They claim to be 100% Open Source. 
- We filed an issue in their repository since there seems to be a version mismatch. The Google Play version was last updated on April 24, 2023. The closest GitHub version we could find shows a Release version 1.2, with a release date of December 11, 2018.  
- Until the provider responds, we would have to label this as **not having their source publicly-available**.
