This app is a trading platform which allows users to buy and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether. It also advertises:

> High security with 2FA for both mobile and web wallets. Store BTC ETH USDT BNB XRP with cold wallet and secure multi-signature with multiple services, including BitGo

(Note that this is a translated quote from [the website](https://www.fiahub.com/))

Cold wallets are often an indication of a custodial offering. As there is no other indication as to who is holding the private keys, this app is classified as such.
