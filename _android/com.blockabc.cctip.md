## App Description 

Description from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blockabc.cctip)

> CCTip Wallet is designed to be the best crypto wallet app by providing a safe, stable, and high-performing experience for our users. It supported thousands of tokens and it is trusted by millions of users worldwide. 

## Analysis 

We downloaded the app and registered. We found support for a BTC wallet which can send and receive. However, there were no provisions for backing up or restoring the private keys. This is a **custodial** service.
