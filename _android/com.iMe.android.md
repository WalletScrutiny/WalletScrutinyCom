## Analysis

- We installed the app. Here are some [screenshots.](https://x.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1832307509446767030)
- As described, the app uses the Telegram API. It retains most of Telegram's aesthetics and messaging functionality. It even imported our Telegram conversations and contacts. The primary change is the added wallet feature.
- The app includes a Bitcoin wallet feature.
- The app provided us with seed phrases for the wallet. 
- The app isn’t directly labeled as Open Source, but there is a [GitHub link](https://github.com/imemessenger/iMe-Android) on their page.
- The repository hasn’t been updated in 4 years, so it doesn’t qualify as source-available. 
- We opened an [issue](https://github.com/imemessenger/iMe-Android/issues/10) to inquire about the app's current status.
