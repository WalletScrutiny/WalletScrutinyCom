## Analysis 

We downloaded and registered with the service. [(Screenshot)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1647154594886352896)

Quite frankly, we had a difficult time analyzing this app as it is in another language. Some clues do present themselves despite the language barrier: 

- The app did not present any seed phrases or options to back or restore a wallet. 
- There seems to be a denomination in "Nectar" ($NTO) and this seems to be the main cryptocurrency in this app. There is an option to send and receive. 
- The platform has KYC verification protocols. 
- It may be possible to convert/exchange cryptocurrencies via their interface. 
- The user has to input the BTC wallet address - this means that the app itself does not provide a BTC address. 

## Verdict 

We believe that this app does not provide a Bitcoin wallet, but rather exchanges this in a way that is similar to ShapeShift:

The user enters a coin address to receive, the provider enters another address for the user to send to. 

This app **does not have a wallet**.
