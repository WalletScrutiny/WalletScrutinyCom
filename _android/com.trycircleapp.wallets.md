> The Circle App uses the latest security mechanism to protect user accounts against unwanted activities by making the user's private keys and sensitive data only available to the user's device by utilizing special encryption algorithms. This ensures that only you can have control over your crypto currencies such as Bitcoin, GTPLUS and GTFTA. No third party including The Circle App itself can either access the user's cryptocurrencies or restrict any transaction user would like to make. All the transactions over the circle app network are secure, safe, anonymous and instantaneous.
