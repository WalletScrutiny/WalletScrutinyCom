The official website, duniapay.net, is down and inaccessible. While there is no information on who holds the private keys, the [Terms of Service](https://sites.google.com/duniapay.net/duniapay-conditiondutilisation/accueil) (found on [the archived website](https://web.archive.org/web/20210730185509/https://www.duniapay.net/)) confirms that the providers can suspend a user's access to their services.

Section 9, translated from French:

> If you engage in any of the above acts and we learn of it, we will consider it a violation of these Terms and we may limit, suspend or otherwise terminate your access to our Platforms and use of our Services.

This app is custodial, and as such, **not verifiable.**
