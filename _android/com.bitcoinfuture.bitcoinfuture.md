After four years with no updates, the app has been updated on August 19, 2023.

## App Description from Google Play 

>  Bitcoin Future can also trade other cryptocurrencies in manual or automatic mode.

## Analysis 

- There are limitations on what users of the service can publish regarding the service as a part of their terms and conditions. 
- It also bears warnings at the footer of their site regarding trading in CFDs and crypto. 
- The warning also informs the user that the app is not a financial app but a marketing tool for brokers to find clients.
- We signed up with the service and verified through email.
- The user then has the option to sign up with binance with the provider's referral code. 
- The next option is to input the user's Binance's API keys.
- We did **not** find any features that indicate that this app provides its **own wallet service**.
