## Analysis

- There was no registration the moment the app initialized. We were immediately brought to the main (home) interface of the app.
- Actionable items included:
  - Connect
  - Deposit
  - T2E
  - Referral
  - Reward
  - Claim and Stake
- The other tab apart from home is Market
- All of the user actions that involve transactions such as 'Deposit' - show a link to other wallets such as WalletConnect, MetaMask, Trust, imToken, TokenPocket, BitKeep, Burrito and Rainbow.
- The same is true with the Swap tab, which features a BTCUSD pair.
- The security settings only included the option to turn on Biometric Recognition.
- Contrary to the app description, we did not find any private keys or any option to back them up.
- Since most transaction functions entail the use of other apps, we deem this app to have **no wallet** function of its own.
