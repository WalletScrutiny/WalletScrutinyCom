About the [service:](https://www.icrypex.com/en)

> Icrypex provides 21 cryptocurrencies and large exchange service by trade volume in 41 currency pairs. 

Also: 

> Your crypto assets are stored in physically isolated, offline, non-networked wallets. These cold wallets are based on physically demanding environmental conditions that can safely store your assets and are free of cyber risks.

The service requires account creation and the submission of identity documents.

From the ICRYPEX [FAQ page:](https://www.icrypex.com/en/faq/how-can-i-create-a-cryptocurrency-address)

> How Can I Create a Cryptocurrency Address?
>
> You can create a wallet by creating an address on your account for coins (BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP, MPAY, BAT, XRP, TRYB) that are within ICRYPEX. To create an address, go to the "My Account" section. Then, by entering the "Assets" section in the left column, select the coin you want to create an address from among the coins at the bottom of the page. Click the "Create A New â€¦.. (BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP, MPAY, BAT, XRP, TRYB) Address" button to create the address of the coin you have selected. Thus, you can easily create your address from the coin you want.

## Analysis 

As a digital asset exchange, this is a **custodial** service. When ICRYPEX mentioned "cold-storage wallets" this means that the wallets are in its custody and therefore, control.
