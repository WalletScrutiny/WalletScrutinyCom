### App Description
From the description:

> Welcome to Mode. Our new look app remains the one-stop place for Bitcoin in the UK, but now includes seamless payments and Bitcoin rewards.

It sounds and looks like a trading platform.

> Here are all the things you can do with Mode:  
> - Access your Bitcoin anytime and anywhere
> - Complete a simple ID verification and top up GBP via 'Open Banking'

Mode also states that it's custodial:	

> Store and send Bitcoin with confidence:
> - Assets are held with one of the world’s most secure crypto custodians
> - Add or send Bitcoin seamlessly
> - Send Bitcoin instantly and for free (no network fees) to other Mode users, anytime, anywhere
