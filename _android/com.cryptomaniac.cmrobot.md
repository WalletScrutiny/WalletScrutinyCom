       Too expensive!! possibly the best bot in theory, however it is costly. Not enough exchanges supported. And nobody wants to pay commission! Maybe if the win rate increased. But still the cost is way too expensive. Needs to support. Trades from 0.002+ btc . Not everyone can blow 0.01 minimum, especially if it's not reliable

       Terrible app, bad buys, awful sells. Unsafe, they have access to app password. Lost $,0000 with this app.

## Analysis 

- The last time the Indonesian website was online was in 2020 
- Registering with the app opens a browser page to cmrobot.id. It displays an error: 

> This site can't be reached. cmrobot.id's server IP address could not be found. 

- As the app description states, this app doesn't allow access to user funds. Judging by most robot trading apps, this makes use of API's. 
- More egregious than **not having a wallet** is the possibility that this app is already **defunct**. The findings above support that conclusion.
