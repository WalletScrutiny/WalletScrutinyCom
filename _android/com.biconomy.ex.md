We advise users to exercise caution around this app. Both the Google Play and the IOS App Store pages were filled with
 reviews where users said they could not withdraw their money. There were also many odd and nonspecific positive reviews which we suspect were paid for.

## App Description

> Biconomy (Biconomy.com) is one of the cryptocurrency platforms that provides global currency trading services for digital assets such as Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum.
>
> Our mission
We believe that the core idea of Bitcoin and blockchain is that distributed ledger and smart contract technology will build the foundation of human trust, improve transaction efficiency, and have a major impact on the society's economy.
>
> Bitcoin and blockchain
Since the birth of Bitcoin, digital assets have been developing rapidly around the world as an Internet technology innovation practice since its inception in 2009. Blockchain technology is derived from Bitcoin, which is currently the largest application practice in blockchain. Our bitcoin and the blockchain behind it are “financial internet”, and it is possible to reconstruct the financial system from the bottom.

## The Reviews

There are many 5-star reviews that were posted around the same day, usually around December 16-18, 2022. These reviews are usually very vaguely written, often stating that the app is "very good" and "easy to use."

Many negative reviews mention losing money to the exchange and the company not providing any customer support.

      I have lost hope and confidence in this project. It looks like they are not real. The Exchange is not working. I placed an order and wish to cancel it, it refused for several months. I laid a complain in the Telegram Group and they banned me. I send a ticket to support, they never responded. I am concluding that this project is a scam and can rug pull at any given time. My advise is, if you have assets in this Exchange, I will advise you pull it with immediate effect. All is not well here.

      ONE WEEK I have had these people dodge me.
      Using Biconomy is risking your funds. This is an FTX disaster waiting to happen. If you withdraw funds you risk the transaction failing, and Biconomy keeping your funds & never helping fix the situation.
