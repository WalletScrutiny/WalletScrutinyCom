## Analysis

- Self-describes as an app that allows you to buy and sell Bitcoin, but primarily transacts using Naira. 

## Other Observations

It is one of those Nigerian "cryto > giftcard > Naira", type of apps. Registration is limited to phone numbers in Nigeria, Kenya and Ghana. Therefore, we were not able to test the app fully. The website and app has us blocked probably based on our physical location. 

> If you hold any crypto such as bitcoins or others, you can sell them on the Pandar app and redeem them for Naira. Itâ€™s extremely seamless to buy or sell crypto using the Pandar app.

This x.com [post](https://x.com/PandarNG/status/1329791003302170628) in 2020 shows options to buy, sell, send and receive Bitcoin.

However, later posts, seems to show problems with the platform's Bitcoin-related functionalities:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Release our money please we need it at least it doesnâ€™t take longs confirm bitcoin on wallet so why are you trying to steal peoples money and lied about old wallet take time to confirm btc what kind of stupid and fraud excuse is that ??? ðŸ˜¡ <a href="https://twitter.com/PandarNG?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PandarNG</a></p>&mdash; bhadboydon (@classicdon4) <a href="https://twitter.com/classicdon4/status/1749334456769355935?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

From these posts, we can deduce that there must have been bitcoin support early in the app's initial release in 2020. This must have been removed later on, or sporadically disabled for a multitude of possible reasons. 

We [posted on x.com](https://x.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1830540030047318150) and will email them to verify if the app still has Bitcoin support. We will mark this app as a **work-in-progress** for the meantime.
