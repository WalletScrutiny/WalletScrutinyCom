**Update 2021-10-09**: We were approached about this verdict being wrong and
while the provider hasn't claimed a fix, we noticed we haven't filed an issue
about the tiny diff in the `crashlytics.android.build_id` neither. To see if
this diff remains, we checked the latest version - `46.10`.

As {{ page.title }} was almost reproducible before, we want to keep track of
their progress as new versions get released now, too.
We had a look at
[their verification script](https://github.com/muun/apollo/blob/master/tools/verify-apollo.sh).
It builds the app from source and unzips both the file from Google and the built
app to diff them.

Surprising is the actual check:

```
# Remove the signature since OSS users won't have Muuns private signing key
rm -r "$tmp"/{to_verify,baseline}/{META-INF,resources.arsc}

diff -r "$tmp/to_verify" "$tmp/baseline" && echo "Verification success!" || echo "Verification failed :("
```

1. The first line is a comment, justifying the removal of the signature, which
   is valid.
2. The second line deletes the `META-INF` folders which does indeed contain the
   signature **but it may contain other stuff, too**. In fact
   [it does](https://github.com/muun/apollo/issues/30).
3. It also **deletes the files `resources.arsc` which has nothing to do with the signature**.
   There is no justification for doing so.

We built
[our own verification script](https://gitlab.com/walletscrutiny/walletScrutinyCom/-/blob/master/scripts/test/android/io.muun.apollo.sh)
which gives us these results:

```

```

For our reproducible verdict
the first three lines of the diff are fine. The last line though, the
`resources.arsc` that their verification script explicitly ignores is not ok.
This file contains resources and altering resources can significantly change the
app, too. This app is **not verifiable**.

Upon closer inspection, the diff again is just the `crashlytics.android.build_id`:

```
