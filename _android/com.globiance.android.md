## Google Play Reviews

  ★★★☆☆ October 28, 2021 <br>
       I was really excited at first! But it's been many days I've been trying to buy GBEX unsuccessfully! Do fiat deposit not available for coins in United States and those available like BTC... addresses are Not Applicable or Available (N/A)! I've been wondering if we have to wait for the USA platform in December or there's another way to get it done!...

## Analysis

- Globiance [indicates](https://globiance.com/transparency.html) that it stores a majority of funds in cold-wallets, making this a **custodial** provider.
