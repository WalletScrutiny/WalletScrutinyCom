## App Description

The app's description is translated from Portuguese:

> Did you take advantage of the high Selic rate and make investments in fixed income? With the Gorilla app, you can closely monitor the profitability of investments! Also track investments in bitcoin, fan token, NFT, shares, BDR, real estate funds (FIIs), ETF and many others! Download the app and manage your investment portfolio in an easy and practical way! In Gorila, you can follow the profitability of more than 400 thousand assets, such as Equity Funds, Real Estate Funds, Treasury Direct and LCA.

Gorila appears to be a trading platform and not a bitcoin wallet per se. [The website](https://gorila.com.br/planos/) also seems to confirm this as it advertises features such as real-life quotation and many other things typically associated with trading platform apps. 

Furthermore, there are no mentions of a bitcoin wallet or seed phrases. If cryptocurrency is supported on this app, it is probably meant to be traded and **cashed out as fiat** currency.
