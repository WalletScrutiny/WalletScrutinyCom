## Updated Review 2023-04-19 

We reached out via their chat support and confirmed that the service does not provide a Bitcoin wallet to the user. [(Screenshot)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1648525697173028864)

## App Description from Google Play 

> This App enables you to transact and exchange bitcoins and gift cards with adequate security features that guarantees safety for clients at all times.

## Analysis 

We tried to register but the website and app's clunky interface would not send a mobile verification code. We will try again tomorrow.
