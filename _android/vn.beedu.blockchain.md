## Analysis

- We registered with the app and verified both our email and our temporary mobile number.
- The app is a multi-currency wallet with BTC support.
- We were provided with a Bech32 BTC address but could not find a means to backup the private keys.
- There were KYC measures in place.
- Based on the information above, we conclude that this is a **custodial** provider.
