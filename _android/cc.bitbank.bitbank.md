### Crypto Security Statement from BitBank

Translated from [Japanese](https://bitbank.cc/doc/security-about)

> At bitbank, when managing crypto assets (virtual currency), we have built a cold wallet using multisig (multiple signatures) and a hot wallet management system using a physically and virtually distributed key management system. Multisig is a mechanism that requires the approval of multiple people to send crypto assets (virtual currency), and is adopted in all bitbank cold wallets for safety.
Cold Wallet Bitbank's cold wallet is managed using multisig in a completely offline environment. Cold wallets are completely isolated from external networks, and in order to transfer crypto assets (virtual currency), multiple people separately apply electronic signatures in an isolated environment. Signed transactions travel through a physical device into a connected environment and then are delivered to the network.

This is enough to indicate that this service is a **custodial** one.
