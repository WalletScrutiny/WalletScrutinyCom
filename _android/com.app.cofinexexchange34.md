## The App

Like in the reviews mentioned beforehand, this app is full of bugs and crashes very often. We attempted to register on the mobile app, but the email OTP never arrived. As a result, we instead used the web application.

[The app is unresponsive when you click the withdraw/deposit button](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1460435718270980097), making it impossible to use as a wallet.

## Verdict

As there has not been a fix since February 2021, we have to conclude that this app is currently **defunct.**
