## Analysis

- The app language is primarily in Portuguese.
- Once we registered we chose the option 'Depositar Fundos'. The available currencies are:
  - USD
  - EUR
  - BRL
- Under 'Depositar Criptomoedas', we were able to find 'Coin: Bitcoin' and 'Network: Bitcoin'. However, it was showing an error:
  > Wallet System is currently offline

- The hamburger menu shows:
  - My Balances
  - Deposit Funds
  - Deposit Cryptocurrencies
  - Withdraw Cryptocurrencies
  - ICO Registrations
  - Pay by Email
  - OTC Registrations
  - Affiliate program
  - My Recommendations
  - My Rewards
  - My friend

- The [Terms](https://x7exchange.com/Article/type/id/9) show a Termination Section in section 6, allowing the platform to freeze and terminate the user's account.
- Sections 3 and 4 discuss the scope of the services provided by the exchange, but there was no mention of their security practices, or whether they used cold-storage or third-party custodians. They do mention that they have the power to 'cancel' instructions provided by the user on the platform and to provide authorities with user information if needed.

Although the platform does not explicitly state the use of cold-storage or other custodial solutions, they do [mention](https://x7exchange.com/Article/type/id/1) a 'central storage technology' and the ability to perform online and offline transactions. More telling is the lack of provisions for private key backups. For these reasons, we give this a verdict of **custodial**.
