## Analysis

- The app provided the 12-word 
- The app can be upgraded:
  > Send invoices & create point of sale checkouts and get paid in either crypto or via credit & debit card to either your ProDoge wallet or Stripe & PayPal account(s)
  >
  > Add multiple line items quickly to create detailed invoices & multi-item point of sales.
  >
  > Upgrade to Premium to connect & receive payments to external crypto wallets.
- The app can be connected to MoonPay and Stripe.
- The BTC receive address is displayed, but strangely, tapping on 'receive', shows us an annoying reminder to upgrade every time we tap it.
- It is also possible to send. 
- External wallets can be connected. 
- There are no claims about the source-availability of the project.
- We searched GitHub Code for the app ID and found [0 results.](https://github.com/search?q=com.prodoge.prodoge&type=code). It does have a SourceForge [page.](https://sourceforge.net/software/product/ALX-Wallet/). But we couldn't find its potential source code there too.
- This app is **not source-available**.
