## App Description from Google Play 

> Multi-Currency Wallet (Soon)
>
> Fast and low-cost interoperable cryptocurrency wallet - store and manage Libocoin (LBY), all digital assets built on Libonomy blockchain as well as popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).

## Analysis 

- The listed website is down
- It claims in its Google Play description that BTC support will be available soon. 
- The last update for the app was last year. 
- We tested the app, were given a choice between 12 or 24-word mnemonics.
- But the only available currencies were LBY and PSIX. 
- Until such time that a BTC wallet is available, we'll mark this with **no BTC support**.
