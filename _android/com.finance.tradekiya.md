## Analysis 

- We were able to register, but curiously, we cannot sign in. 
- Although this is an exchange, we cannot see a BTC pair. The available currencies were: FUFI, TRX, USDT, ETH, BNB, DOGE, XRP, SHIB, MANA and CIN.
- We were not able to login both on the mobile app and the web interface. 
- There was a notice that INR deposits and withdrawals will experience considerable delays. 

Although this is a cryptocurrency exchange, **we cannot find proof that it supports BTC**.
