## Google Play Reviews

       App has a lot to do to compete with other trade apps. Can't Minimize the app without me having to login again especially when I minimize it to retrieve OTP from email, going back to the app it I will require me to login again and automatically requiring a new OTP , as if that not enough,to verify Identity must there be expiry date? The expiry date has been a key factor for me not being able to verify my id cause am only having NIN slip which doesn't have an expiry date.

       This app is so bad and their charges are so ridiculous, any withdrawal transactions on tatcoin takes changes of 85 tatcoins of over #1000, and even Naira withdrawal charges are just too much, I have dash you guys the remaining money in my account, am uninstalling this app right away, I can't keep going through that frustrations. Won't recommend this app to anyone to download

## Analysis 

- The app merely displays an under maintenance graphic.
- With both the app and the website both not functioning, this app is already **defunct**.
