## Verdict

The previous quote is very telling of this app's custodial nature. Maintaining a stance of "cooperation with law enforcement authorities, and attesting that they would **not hesitate** to seize, freeze, terminate the account and funds of Users", is highly indicative of a **custodial** service. This makes the app **not verifiable**.
