## App Description from Google Play

> The META 1 Wallet App is a light weight mobile application that allows users to Send, Receive and Exchange coins instantly with anyone in the world from the palm of your hand. Leveraging the powerful private META 1 Blockchain that puts the power back in your hands with it's decentralized peer to peer architecture.

## Analysis

- This app is also known as the Meta 1 Lite Wallet as seen from this [page](https://meta-exchange.vision/home/).
- After email verification the app asked us to have our face photographed.
- We were uncomfortable with this so did not proceed. Interestingly, they justify this:
  > Our decentralized exchange has no KYC requirements other than you must be a living breathing human. META Exchange also does not allow corporations or fictional entities to use the platform, creating a truly freedom-centered, focused human platform that is for the human by the human.
- The [terms](https://meta1coin.vision/terms-and-conditions) somehow have some political undertones:
  > As members, we affirm our belief in the original 1787 Constitution for the United States of America. We believe that the First Amendment of the original 1787 Constitution for the United States of America guarantees our members the rights of free speech, petition, assembly, and the right to gather together for the lawful purpose of advising and helping one another in asserting our rights under the Federal and State Constitutions and Statutes. 
- We tried to sign-in via the web app, and it asked for the same verification - a facial photograph.
- We can see from this [help document](https://support.meta1coin.vision/hc/en-us/articles/16567681846555-How-to-buy-META-1-coin) a screenshot which shows an option to deposit or send Bitcoin.
- Somehow, we find ourselves on their exchange with a [BTC/USDT](https://meta-exchange.vision/market/BTC_USDT) trading pair.
- As evidenced in this [video](https://support.meta1coin.vision/hc/en-us/articles/11552910107931-How-to-create-paper-wallet-), the private keys can be generated by selecting the "generate a paper wallet" option. From there, the user inputs a "passkey" which then creates the paper wallet PDF file which contains the private key.

- We did not find any claims that it was source-available.
- We did find a relevant GitHub repository when using the app ID. The latest release tag is for version 1.1.1. The Android apk version on Google Play is version 1.1.8. This app is up **for verification**.
