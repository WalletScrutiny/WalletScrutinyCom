## App Description from Google Play 

> Our easy-to-use web browser lets you customize the default website address, so you can explore the exchange rates that matter to you.

## Analysis 

- The app just closes upon opening
- The listed website for the app, points to a near empty blogspot page and a generic wixsite for an app developer
- The description describes this app as a web browser
- We'll email the provider at hanchanglin@gmail.com
- But for now, we have enough to show that this app is both **defunct** and **not a wallet**.
