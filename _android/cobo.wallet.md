**Update:** This wallet was one of the first wallets that was analyzed and back
then the custodial wallet was detrimental to call the full wallet custodial.
As it apparently also has a non-custodial part, this verdict is not accurate
anymore.

This app is at least primarily a custodial wallet:

> **Cloud Wallet**
> 
> Designed for user convenience and worry-free investing
> 
> Generate stable returns on your crypto assets
> 
> Free, instant transfers between Cobo Wallet users

but also has a non-custodial

> **HD Wallet**
> 
> Take full control of your assets and private keys for maximum safety
> 
> Easily import your mnemonic seeds from other wallets you may own
> 
> Support for DApps
> 
> EOS & Tron voting

As there is no source code available, claims cannot be checked, which is why the
verdict has to be: this wallet is **not verifiable**.
