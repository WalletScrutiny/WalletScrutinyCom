## Analysis 

- The website for this app is no longer online. The latest archive was made in 2019. 
- We tried to register with the app, but clicking on "Sign Up" after filling the fields, does not result in anything. 
- We believe this app is already **defunct**, but we'll send the provider an email to double-check. 
- The email bounced with an address not found error. This is definitely a defunct app.
