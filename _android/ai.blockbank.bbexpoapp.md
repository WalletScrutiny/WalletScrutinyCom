## Analysis

The blockbank app purportedly provides both custodial and self-custodial services. You can create or import your own wallet right away while the option for centralized finance requires KYC / AML verification. 

Although images of the app on Google Play and the [official website](https://blockbank.ai/) showed that Bitcoin was a supported asset, when we installed the app we did not see the option to withdraw or deposit BTC.
We could not find information on whether the app's source code was available for review. Because this app has custodial and self-custodial wallets, and neither of which can be considered verifiable, we conclude our analysis of the product here.

Verdict: **Not verifiable,** no source available for review.
