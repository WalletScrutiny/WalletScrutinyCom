## Analysis

- Upon startup we were given the chance to create a new wallet or import.
- We were then asked to input a 4-digit pin code.
- Then we were shown the main interface.
- We accessed the backup phrase by going to settings. The mnemonic is composed of 12 words.
- The BTC address is Bech32.
- There are send, receive, P2P and buy options.
- There are no claims about the app's source-availability. There were [no results](https://github.com/search?q=com.blocknance.wallet&type=code) on GitHub when we did a code search.
- This app is **not source-available**.
