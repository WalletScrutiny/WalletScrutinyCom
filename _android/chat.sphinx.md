## App Description from Google Play

> Sphinx.chat lets you use your lightning node to talk to anyone else who is running lightning and a sphinx compatible chat client. You can get a hosted node at https://sphinx.chat or run your own lightning node.

## App Description from Homepage

- Decentralize social media and take back your data
- Truly secure chat. End to end encrypted chat with no central server
using the bitcoin lightning network.
- Buy using bitcoin on lightning. Sphinx lets you talk and pay.
- You can send bitcoin over lightning instantly to anyone in the world.

## Analysis 

- When we started the app, it asked us for an **invitation code.** We searched on twitter for an invitation code and could not find any. We did find several people asking for one. 
- Apparently, downloading the app is not enough to see its features. We would have to purchase, subscribe or set up a node. There are 3 options: Lite, Dedicated and Home Nodes. 

We found a descriptive video, however it is in German. (You can enable English captions):

The primary purpose of the app is social. To be able to use Sphinx, you must have a node set up. The nodes could come from other sources and therefore, not necessarily a core feature of the app. Thus, though the app would include what appears to be the functionality of a lightning wallet, it has **no standalone wallet** that could function without subscribing or setting up your own node - which should have their own wallets.
