## App Description from Google Play

> VynkPay Crypto Wallet allows the users to store crypto securely. Sending and receiving funds are very easy using VynkPay wallet. It support multi blockchains where you can exchange BEP20, ERC20 & TRC20. 

## Analysis 

- There is a BTC wallet that can send/receive, but these functions are only available after KYC
- Section 6 Number 4 of the terms indicates that Vynk retains full custody of digital assets after termination of the user's account.
- We did not find any options to backup the private keys. 
- These all point to a **custodial** app.
