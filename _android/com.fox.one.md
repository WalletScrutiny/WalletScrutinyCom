  ★☆☆☆☆ August 30, 2021 <br>
       Don't know what is going on but it seems that is not working. You can not exchange BTC for USDT anymore. It seems that project has been abandoned.

## The App

We tried installing and registering the app, however when we try to input the captcha it returns an error: "Operation Forbidden" This causes problems because you cannot attempt to continue without filling the entire sign-in form.

## Verdict

All indications point to an app that is **no longer working.**
