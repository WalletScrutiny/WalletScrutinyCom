⚠️ Warning: This Mongolia only exchange bears the same name as several other cryptocurrency entities in Canada and elsewhere. 

## App Description

> We invite you to become an owner of our Cryptocurrency Exchange, together, we will build the leading, most innovative, and secure exchange in the Central Asia Region.

From the [Play Store description.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinhub.pro)

## Analysis 

- CoinHub is a Mongolian cryptocurrency exchange. 
- CoinHub has issued its own token (CHB)
- The token uses the same ticker as that of another token from another exchange.
- It has a similar name to another cryptocurrency exchange, but has a .mn ccTLD instead of .io. They are different entities.
- This particular exchange is focused in the Central Asian market. 

### From the [Terms and Conditions](https://www.coinhub.mn/about-terms)

> 3.2.2. Transfer of virtual assets from a wallet to another wallet of the Exchange is carried out between the Exchange and a third-party virtual asset service provider or wallet service provider.

> 3.2.5.1. Surname and first name of recipient individual/ name of legal entity;
> 3.2.5.2. Recipient's registered address;
> 3.2.5.3. Purpose of transfer;

We were not able to install the app due to geographical filters. On page translation was also not working. 

We were able to access the trading page which included a BTC/MNT pair. 

As evidenced from section 3.2.5 of the CoinHub Terms and Conditions, we assume that the exchange exercises **custodial** control over their users' funds because of the need for customer information prior to transfer. 

This is most notably expressed in 3.2.6: 

> 3.2.6. In the event that the customer's transfer information is incomplete or incorrect, the Exchange will suspend the transfer until the information is complete and accurate.
