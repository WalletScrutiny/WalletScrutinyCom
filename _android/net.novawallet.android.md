## App Description

> Nova Wallet is a non-custodial, decentralised wallet, where users have full control of their VSOL, WVSol, BTC, BNB, DOGE, ETH, USDT & BUSD and their own private keys.
>
> Nova Wallet acts as an interface. It allows you to interact with many blockchains without ever giving up your private keys or the passcode to your funds.
>
> For more information about VSOL & WVSOL go to www.vsolidus.com & www.novawallet.co.uk


## Analysis

Upon installing the app, Nova Wallet provides the option to create or import a wallet. The user is provided with an 18 word seed phrase as the recovery key and asked to write them down. Verification methods include a password and either a fingerprint, a pin lock, or a pattern lock.

Although the provider claims it is self-custodial and they have a (seemingly inactive) [GitHub profile](https://github.com/VSolidus) we did not find any source code for {{ page.title }}.

Verdict: No source available for review makes this app **not verifiable.**
