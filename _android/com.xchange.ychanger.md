## App Description from Google Play 

> You can buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, Tether, Zcash, Dogecoin, Dash, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum Classic, as well as sell, quickly and easily using the Ychanger service application.

## Analysis 

- [Screenshots](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1667475586548219906)
- [Section 3.3 of the Terms](https://ychanger.net/en/rules/) details all the ways the platform can exercise control over transactions, including freezing user funds and suspension. More telling is the ability of the provider to **block the user** from using the app. 
- We did not find the option to backup private keys 
- This is a **custodial service**.
