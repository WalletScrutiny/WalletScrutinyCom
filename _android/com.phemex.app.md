The Phemex mobile app claims to hold funds in cold storage...

> All assets are 100% stored in cold wallets. Each withdrawal is thoroughly monitored and requires two-person approval with offline signatures.

leads us to conclude the wallet funds are in control of the provider and hence custodial.

Our verdict: This 'wallet' is custodial and therefore is **not verifiable**.
