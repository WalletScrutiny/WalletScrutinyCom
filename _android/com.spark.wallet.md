## App Description

From its GitHub page:

>Spark is a minimalistic wallet GUI for c-lightning, accessible over the web or through mobile and desktop apps (for Android, Linux, macOS and Windows). It is currently oriented for technically advanced users and is not an all-in-one package, but rather a "remote control" interface for a c-lightning node that has to be managed separately.
>
> Sparks supports sending and receiving payments, viewing history, and managing channels.
>
> Spark is a purely off-chain wallet, with no on-chain payments. This allows Spark to fully realize the awesome UX enabled by lightning, without worrying about the complications and friction of on-chain. This might change someday.
>
> Spark has a responsive UI suitable for mobile, tablet and desktop devices, but is best optimized for use on mobile.

## The App

As described above, the mobile app acts like a "remote-control interface for a
c-lightning node". If a user is running his own lightning node, then the user is
fully in control of his funds. This app, as its remote control also could to bad
things if with a backdoor or a serious flaw. Therefore we consider it as a
self-custodial wallet, requiring binary transparency.

## Reproducibility

GitHub is their website and there is also their source code. On the main page in
the paragraph
[Code signing & reproducible builds](https://github.com/shesek/spark-wallet#code-signing--reproducible-builds)
they state:

> The NPM package, Linux `AppImage`/`snap`/`tar.gz` builds, macOS `zip` builds
  and the Windows installer
  [are deterministically reproducible](https://github.com/shesek/spark-wallet/blob/master/doc/reproducible-builds.md).

linking to a document that itself claims that also the "Android `apk`" was also
reproducible. Let's see how that goes ...

```
$ mkdir ~/tmp
$ cd ~/tmp/
$ git clone https://github.com/shesek/spark-wallet && cd spark-wallet
$ git checkout v0.3.1 
HEAD is now at 4ffb929 v0.3.1

```

Ok. That was not successful. Dependencies can go away and reproduction might
succeed with a newer version of this now unavailable dependency. We will wait
for the provider to figure out if the reproducible build still works after a
short fix and consider the app in the meantime as **not verifiable**.
