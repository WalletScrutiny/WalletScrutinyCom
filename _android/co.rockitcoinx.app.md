## Analysis

- Registration required an email address, first and last name and a phone number.
- The [Terms and Conditions](https://www.rockitcoin.com/terms-of-service/) of the site:
  - May refuse an account to the user.
  - Claims to not have custody of any user funds.
  - May terminate a user's account upon its discretion.
- Once we have verified our throwaway US phone number, we were shown the main app interface.
- We clicked on 'Wallet' in the bottom panel and to our surprise, the app enjoined us to "Create an account" with what we think is another provider, Edge.
- There is a [tweet](https://twitter.com/TheRealXMoney/status/1534693878439325698) that says that the Edge referred to in this app is in fact: {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/co.edgesecure.app' verdict='true' %}. We tried confirming this with them on [twitter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1677267338972872706).
- We were provided with a P2SH BTC address on the same app.
- There was an option to back up the private keys. It can be presented in seed phrases or the raw private key.
- This is a self-custodial wallet.
- Despite the link with Edge, we're going to search GitHub for RockitCoin's app ID.
- There was [no result](https://github.com/search?q=co.rockitcoinx.app&type=code) when we did a code search on GitHub for the RockitCoin app ID.
- This app is **not source-available**.
