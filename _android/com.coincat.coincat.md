## Analysis 

This Russian exchange is similar to {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.changelly.app' verdict='true' %}, which lets users exchange from a set of choices. First, users have to select a pair to trade in. Then they provide the amount they wish to exchange. Then, they would have to provide a wallet address from an external wallet or an account number (in case of fiat) to receive in. They then send from the origin pair to exchange.

The platform **does not provide a wallet** for the user.
