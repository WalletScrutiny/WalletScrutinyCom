## Analysis 

Users can only deposit and withdraw USDT [(Screenshot Proof on Twitter)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1646403887610617856/photo/2). 

There are no options to deposit or withdraw actual cryptocurrencies apart from USDT.

This qualifies it as an app that can **neither send or receive BTC**.
