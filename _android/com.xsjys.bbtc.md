## Analysis 

Most exchanges that offer multi-wallet support are custodial in nature. There are some things that are unique to CDEX which give us pause before giving it a custodial verdict. For one, despite claims that it 'has Bitcoin', users can only deposit and withdraw USDT [(Screenshot Proof on Twitter)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1646403887610617856/photo/2). Furthermore, users can also trade this USDT to BTC. This qualifies it as an app that can **neither send or receive BTC**. This makes it also a custodial provider, thus, the app **cannot be verified**.
