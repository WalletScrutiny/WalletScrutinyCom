## Analysis

It's inadvisable to utilize an app for short term exchanging of assets in Africa for a different purpose such as long-term storage of private keys. Especially when it is not marketed as anything other than a Kenyan app for trading cryptocurrencies.

In the [FAQs,](https://tapswap.io/faqs/) "Can I transfer cash or Bitcoin from one TapSwap account to another TapSwap account?", it is stated that users can withdraw BTC to an external address. However, a Pro Account is required to be able to do this, which as of this date, is purportedly "coming soon" according to the website.

> No. It is not possible to transfer cash or Bitcoin between two TapSwap accounts. However, you are free to withdraw your funds or Bitcoin to any external (non-TapSwap) address and then deposit those funds into a TapSwap account.
>
> NOTE: Transfer of Bitcoin from your TapSwap account will only be available on the Pro account. Pro accounts have on-chain capability while Basic accounts do not.

As with most custodial entities, [TapSwap is also capable of terminating your access to their services. (17. Suspension;Termination)](https://tapswap.io/terms-of-service/)

This qualifies TapSwap to a custodial verdict, which also makes it **nonverifiable**. However, because sending and receiving bitcoin is locked behind a Pro account, and Pro accounts have purportedly not yet been implemented, we instead assign this app with the "no sending and receiving" verdict.
