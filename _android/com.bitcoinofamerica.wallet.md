**Update 2022-02-03**: This app is no more.

In the description we read:

> Bitcoin of America Wallet is a powerful and easy to use cryptocurrency wallet
  that allows users to easily control their own private keys with the
  familiarity and ease of mobile banking.

and

> Open-source code. Available at `https://github.com/Airbitz`

but [that GitHub account](https://github.com/Airbitz) is of
another wallet: {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.airbitz' %} and certainly not under the provided
link as there is no code there
[or anywhere else on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=com.bitcoinofamerica.wallet).

As the provider's website also is down as of now, we don't expect much from this
wallet and file it as **not verifiable**.
