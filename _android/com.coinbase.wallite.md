This app is provided by the same developer as
{% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.coinbase.android' %}, the
[provided website](https://wallet.coinbase.com/) links to yet another app,
{% include walletLink.html wallet='android/org.toshi' %} though. It's a bit confusing.

Reading the description it turns out, this app is for ETH only.
