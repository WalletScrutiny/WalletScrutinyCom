## App Description from Google Play 

> We will notify you of exchange announcements including Upbit, Bithumb, and Binance Futures.
> - Conditional search is also possible with coins.
- RSI and sub-indicator RBI notification are supported.
- Recommended if you are uncomfortable using TradingView Alert.
- You can respond to major indices, premiums, and market prices for each exchange.

## Analysis 

- The website is mostly in the Korean language
- With some difficulty, we weren't able to find any wallet icons or anything that resembles the bitcoin logo or denomination. It appears to be a trading-training app with the possibility of connecting to some exchanges via API. 
- This app **does not have a wallet**.
