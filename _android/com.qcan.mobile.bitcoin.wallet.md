## Update 2024-07-13

No changes have been noted regarding the source-availability of this app.

## Review 2020-12-08

> **Complete Control**<br>
  Your Bitcoin, 100% Under Your Control. You hold the key. No intermediary.

That is a clear claim to be non-custodial but neither on Google Play nor the
website can we find a link to source code. This app is thus **not verifiable**.
