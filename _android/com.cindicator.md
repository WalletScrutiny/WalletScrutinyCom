## Analysis 

**This is not a wallet**. This is an app that allows users to participate in a guessing game. The game consists of guessing the price movements of certain cryptocurrencies or markets over a period of time. 

The rewards are given in their own ERC-20 token. The platform [recommends wallets](https://support.cindicator.com/en/articles/5355594-what-wallets-can-i-use-to-receive-rewards) with ETH support such as:
- Trust Wallets 
- Exodus 
- Metamask
- MyEtherWallet
