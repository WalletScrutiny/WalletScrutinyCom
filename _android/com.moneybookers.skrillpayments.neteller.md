## [Neteller Cryptocurrency Terms and Conditions](https://www.neteller.com/en/policies-terms/cryptocurrency-terms-of-use/)

- Many of the clauses regarding how cryptocurrencies are handled in the platform are described as "instructions". An example:

> 9. P2P Transfers
> 
> 9.2 You may submit a P2P Transfer Instruction by selecting the Supported Cryptocurrency, specifying the amount you wish to transfer, selecting the Existing Member to whom you wish to send your interest and confirming the P2P Transfer.
>
> 9.3 When you confirm the P2P Transfer, we will immediately carry out the P2P Transfer. You won’t be able to cancel the P2P Transfer Instruction once it has been received by us.

Although, no mention of cold storage, private keys or seeds are found in the app's website, there is enough to reasonably conclude that this is a **custodial** service with a non-verifiable app.
