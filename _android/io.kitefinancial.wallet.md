## Analysis 

According to {{ page.title }}'s Terms of Service, 

> You may only purchase cryptocurrency on kitefinancial when you have satisfied all verification/identity check. Certain limits are placed on your usage and ability to purchase cryptocurrency on kitefinancial, these limitations depends on your level of verification and kitefinancial have all rights to reduce, increase such limits without any prior notice. 

Most services that provide *usage tiers*, indicate a a centralized account management system. The more a user verifies, the more features an app or service may offer. Clearly, **not a non-custodial feature**. 

This, together with [legal compliance measures](https://www.kitefinancial.io/legal-compliance) are also clues to the type of service they have. 

Finally, the strongest proof that this is a **custodial** service is the non-provisioning of the seed phrases. The app **cannot be verified**.
