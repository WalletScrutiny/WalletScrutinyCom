## Analysis

- Once we selected 'Create a new wallet', a new 'decentralized identity' was created. It consisted of a 35-character string.
- We were initially given two token types: ABT (ArcBlock) and ETH.
- Clicking on the 3 dots, we were then presented with these choices:
  - Manage Tokens
  - Add Token by Contract
  - Supported chain and tokens?
- The only available networks are ArcBlock, Ethereum, EVM-compatible chains (BSC), and Solana. BTC was not included.
- This app **does not support the Bitcoin network.**
