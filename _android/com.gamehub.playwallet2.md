## App Description from Google Play 

> Experienced personnel in the security field participated in the development of PlayWallet. We have adopted a variety of measures to ensure the safety of our wallets, such as mnemonic word, OTP, and secure cloud backup.

## Analysis 

- We tried to run the app, but it simply gave an error: 

> Network Communication Error. 
>
> Please re-check the network.

- Its listed website's last known archive.org entry was in [2020.](https://web.archive.org/web/20200120033903/http://www.playwallet.io/)

Some text from the archive: 

> We hire all means to keep your wallet safe. Experience exceptional security through mnemonics, OTP, and secure cloud backup.

- With a non-working app, an offline website, and with an app that was last updated in 2020, this app is very likely to be **defunct**.
