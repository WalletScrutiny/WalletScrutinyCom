## Analysis 

- The website has a downloadable apk with a different version number (v.1.0). The one in Google Play is v.1.3.9
- We were not able to install the app on BlueStacks 5, Android Nougat, Pie and on Android Studio emulator API 27. 
- We proceeded to install instead the downloadable APK from their site.
- We were able to install it. [(Screenshots)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1661912585908649985)
- It is a multicoin wallet primarily denominated in CNY. 
- We solved the captcha in order to receive the verification email. 
- We received it.
- We inputted a password and a pin.
- Users can pay for utilities, property management, water supply, gardening, and agriculture. This seems to be an app template for linking to real companies. Clicking 'Pay' for instance, results in a 'Coming Soon' message. 
- Initially, clicking deposit Bitcoin, would result in the app asking us to login again. After clicking around the interface, it finally generated a BTC wallet address. We believe this is a flaw or a bug.
- This app has a BTC wallet that can send and receive. However, we did not find any option to backup the mnemonic phrase. Thus, it is **custodial**.
