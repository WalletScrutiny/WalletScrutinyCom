## Notes 

We tried to register with the app but did not receive the confirmation email. Its support page containing its Terms and Conditions was inaccessible. 

Exchanges are almost always likely to be a **custodial** service. 

We did find a third-party [article](https://azcoinnews.com/why-did-vcc-exchange-stop-providing-services-to-vietnamese-users.html) indicating that the service provider has terminated its services to Vietnam. If this is true universally, it would only be a matter of time when the service goes completely offline.
