  ★☆☆☆☆ <br>
  Bad App, don't waste your time downloading this app. I regret doing so, almost all the features not working, keep on saying coming soon. Verification pending for almost a month. I regret sending my data to them....

### [Terms and Conditions](https://www.infipay.io/terms-conditions/)

> InfiPay **maintains full custody of the funds** and User data/information which may be given to governmental authorities in the event of Account suspension/closure arising from fraud investigations, violation of law investigations or violation of these Terms.

## The App

We registered with the service and it required the following: email, phone, address, birth date and country.

Prior to using the app, they requested a valid government ID and a selfie.

We were able to temporarily bypass the verification window. There is a bitcoin wallet that can send or receive. However, before the user can do so, the user has to verify his or her identity.

We were not able to locate the seed phrases or private keys.

## Verdict

Bitcoin wallet features that are locked in prior to ID verification is a good indicator for a service's **custodial** nature. If a service can lock features of a wallet before the user verifies, they can most certainly lock it after. Thus, the app **cannot be verified**.
