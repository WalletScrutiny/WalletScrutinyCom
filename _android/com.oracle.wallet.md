## The App

We downloaded the app and [posted a screenshot on twitter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1458351211078320128). The app doesn't seem to have BTC support yet.

## Verdict

Going back to the Google Play app description, we saw that bitcoin wallet support was an **"UPCOMING FEATURE"**. This means that the wallet is not yet supported. Until they respond, or until BTC support is introduced, this app **does not support BTC**.
