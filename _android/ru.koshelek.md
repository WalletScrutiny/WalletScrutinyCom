## The Site

The site reflects the user account created from the app. There seems to be more information and functionalities available on the website.

Part of this is the roadmap ([image copied and posted on twitter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1452888402412507139)). See above to see that a "blockchain wallet" that is described as self-custodial will be launched sometime in the 2nd Quarter of 2020-2021. The details were not specified. 

Apart from that, most of the website seems to be a P2P cryptocurrency exchange. Multiple cryptocurrency wallets are also available including Bitcoin. Coins can be sent, received or staked (when applicable). 

## The App

We tried the app and registered an account. We were asked to confirm this through email as well as create a PIN. 

There is a multi-currency wallet which includes BTC. We could not locate the private keys, or a backup option on the app itself. 

ID verification includes: proof of identity, proof of address and selfie with ID.

2FA consists of Google authenticator

There is also a referral program and an academy.

## Contact

We contacted Koshelek via twitter to ask about their "[blockchain wallet](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1452884341894225922)"

## Verdict

Judging this app was difficult as it has many features. At its most basic, **it is a custodial** service. However, they are promising a self-custodial solution in the form of the "blockchain wallet", sometime in the future. Until that has been released, we believe that the app **cannot be verified.**
