## Similar App Note 2023-08-23

This app is from the same developer of {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.trusteewallet' verdict='true' %}. 

We verified that both apps are linked from their homepage.

## App Description from Google Play

> Transfer money, buy, sell cryptocurrency in just a few touches.
>
> The application is free, but access is provided only to persons who have pending transfer or accepted by Trustee Plus family members.

### From the Homepage

> Services such as Trustee Plus do not require a key. After registering with your phone number, you can restore the wallet simply by contacting tech support and following the instructions.

## Analysis 

- We were able to register and found a Bech32 BTC address that can send and receive. 
- Section 5.3 of the [terms](https://trusteeglobal.eu/terms-of-use/) describes part of the service as a hosted custodial wallet.

Since the wallet does not provide the private keys, this app is **custodial** and therefore **not-verifiable**.
