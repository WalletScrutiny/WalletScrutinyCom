## App Description

From the description:

> ToolsTrades, the worldâ€™s biggest and most successful trading signals providers. Since founded in 2012, we have been sending our members trading signals for Forex, CFD, Crypto and Stocks trading.

Because this app is meant for providing trading signals, it is not actually a wallet or exchange. While the app states that it offers many services:

> From market reviews and the latest news from the financial world, to guides and economic calendars

Holding and managing cryptocurrencies is not one of them.


## The App and Verdict

There's not much to note about the app. There's **no wallet services** and you cannot send, receive, or buy bitcoin as it's meant to provide trading signals.
