## Analysis 

- We tried signing up, but received a "Sign-up Unavailable" error. 
- This may have something to do with their [announcement](https://coinspaid.com/tpost/0zx28tmj51-coinspaid-is-back-to-processing-after-be) which states that they were hacked and lost $37.3 Million last July. They also claim that user funds were not affected.
- While this is going on, we look at Section 3.3 of the terms which states that the provider holds the private keys to user accounts.

This is a **custodial** provider with a **non-verifiable** app.
