## App Description

> FAMEEX provides crypto trading services for worldwide users, such as bitcoin, ETH and ADAâ€¦,etc.

Security

> Top security: full node wallet, split storage between hot and cold wallets, insurance fund, transparent data management.
>
> Trade in diversification: support bitcoin spots, grid, futures and leverage trading.

## The Site

> FAMEEX adopts the "full node wallet method" to store funds, and generates public and private keys corresponding to the "asymmetric encryption technology" based on the one-way hash function algorithm to ensure that the funds on the chain are undecipherable. In addition, FAMEEX also separates and encrypts the hot and cold wallets, splits the private key randomly, and then encrypts the storage in the library, and sets multiple read permissions to achieve the purpose of wallet privacy and security management.
