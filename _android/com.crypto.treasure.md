## App Description from Google Play

> Store, Send and Receive: you can store, send and receive Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), Avalanche (AVAX), Celo (CELO), Smart Chain (BNB), Arbitrum (ARETH), Fantom (FTM), Polygon (MATIC), Huobi ECO (HT), Gnosis (xDAI), Cronos (CRO), Optimistic (OETH), and other altcoins, with zero fees, your assets will be in a secure and private wallet. In addition, your private keys will be under your control because TREASURE WALLET is a self-custody crypto wallet, and only you will have an access to your funds.

## Analysis

- The app claims to support BTC, but we were not able to test the app due to an [error](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1696794251789771086) during registration. 
- Assuming all its claims are true, then this is a self-custodial app. 
- There were **no claims regarding source-availability**.
- A search for the app ID in GitHub Code, resulted in [0 results](https://github.com/search?q=com.crypto.treasure&type=code) with some unrelated commits.

We were not able to test this app because of that error, so we had to assume that its claims are true. With that said, this app is still **not source-available**.
