## Update 2024-07-15

This app is evidently **custodial**. As stated in section 12.4 of their [Terms](https://www.giottus.com/docs/termsandconditions.html): 

> Digital Currency Storage & Transmission Delays: Giottus securely stores all Digital Currency private keys in our control in a combination of online and offline storage. As a result, it may be necessary for Giottus to retrieve certain information from offline storage in order to facilitate a Cryptocurrency Transaction in accordance with your instructions, which may delay the initiation or crediting of such Cryptocurrency Transaction for 48 hours or more. You acknowledge and agree that a Cryptocurrency Transaction facilitated by Giottus may be delayed.
