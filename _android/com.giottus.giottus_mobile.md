> Peer to Peer exchange facilitates transactions between two traders without routing the money through the exchange. Giottus lets a Buyer buy without sending INR to the Exchange.

Giottus requires KYC verification, but because of their use of P2P exchange it appears that they don't control the clients' funds. 

While our verdict for this app is **not custodial** there's still **no source.**
