## App Description from Google Play

> Byte Exchange provides a secure and reliable wallet for storing your digital assets. Our security features ensure that your cryptocurrencies are safe and protected.

This is a cryptocurrency trading platform.

## Analysis 

Like most cryptocurrency exchange apps, they do have a [terms and conditions](https://bytedex.io/en/user-agreements/) page. Section 3.21 states:

> 3.21. Bytedex is obliged to exercise the utmost care as a prudent trader for the security of cryptocurrencies in accounts held on behalf of Users. Usersâ€™ cryptocurrencies are stored in cold storage (cold storage) without an internet connection against any cyber-attack. However, despite all these efforts of Bytedex, Bytedex cannot be held responsible for any theft/fraud that may still occur.

The provider advertises that it is planning to provide a separate "decentralized ByteWallet - soon". But for now their app, like many exchange apps, is definitely a host-based **custodial** platform, making it **non-verifiable**.
