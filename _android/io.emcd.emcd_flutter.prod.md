- The app has a wallet tab in the bottom bar, which offers 3 options: Balance, Coinhold or P2P.
  - **Balance**: Users can top up, exchange or withdraw. One of the addresses provided is a Bech 32 BTC address.
  - **Coinhold**: Users can save their crypto and earn interest income on EMCD's Coinhold feature.
  - **P2P**: Users can trade with others.
- This is a complex app with at least 3 different services: coinhold, mining and p2p trading. They also provide a wallet, but these wallets do not come with a private key backup.
- We give this a verdict of **custodial** for the reasons stated above.
