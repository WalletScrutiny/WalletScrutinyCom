Their site is a [Github hosted website](https://monya-wallet.github.io/).

## The App

We tried the app. Some portions of it were in Japanese, although you can choose to receive your mnemonics in English. After the user is provided with a passphrase, the app asks you to set a password. You can add several other cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin. It is possible to send and receive Bitcoin.

## Verdict

This app is self-custodial. However, upon attempting to verify this code, [we got the following:](https://github.com/monya-wallet/monya/issues/130)

> Building version 3.10.4 and comparing it to version from google-play, result in below diff:<br>
Command: `diff --recursive --brief ./monya_local_build_3.10.4_2/ ./monya-from-google-play`

> Result:
