## Analysis 

- The website has recently gone offline
- Web archive still shows entry in the early part of 2023
- This app has a very-high likelihood of being a custodial exchange by virtue of its usage of cold-storage. But, it is also very likely to be **defunct**.
- We [tweeted](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1664898818872156160) and emailed them to verify. 
- Since the app was recently updated, we'll keep the verdict as **custodial** at the interim.
