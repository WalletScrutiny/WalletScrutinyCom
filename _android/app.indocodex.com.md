## App Description from Google Play 

> Indocodex gives you the ability to trade digital assets like Rajacoin, Rajagas, Bitcoin, Ethereum and others. We also accept deposits via IDR through partnerships with several local banks.
>
> We put a lot of emphasis on being a decentralized exhange versus a centralized one. Our decentralized model means we never hold your assets. Your assets are kept in your own secure wallet. All our trades are done and recorded on the blockchain.

## Analysis 

- The website is now offline 
- Clicking on Help & Support on the app redirects to rajacoin.io/support - which is now offline as well.
- We tried several times to register but the app kept returning an error: "*Your account is not registered"
- We believe this app is defunct, but for the benefit of the doubt, we will email the listed email address to verify. 
- While we await their response, we'll keep this as a work-in-progress.
