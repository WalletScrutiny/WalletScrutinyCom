## Analysis 

- We tried to install the app, but it merely showed a blank screen. 
- We [tweeted](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1655874387059556352) the provider for updates.
- We also contacted them via web form. 
- We'll retain the verdict for this until more information is available.
