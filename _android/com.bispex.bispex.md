## Analysis 

- [(Screenshots)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1656905209678036993)
- This is a cryptocurrency exchange 
- We were able to find an option to deposit/withdraw BTC option on the platform 
- We were not able to locate the option for backing up the private keys.
- As the terms suggests, the wallet of the user is tied to the BISPEX account. Withdrawals also need the "request" of users. These are the hallmarks of a **custodial provider.**
- Custodial services are permissioned services, hence, another proof that this is custodial is that when we tried to deposit BTC, it showed an error: 

> Service Error!
>
> [74006] Temporary error creating wallet. Please try again later. (Trcode: 77623)
>
> Temporarily Suspended
>
> - BTC deposit feature has been suspended
> - Apologies for the inconvenience caused
>
> We will try to resume the feature as soon as possible.

If this were a self-custodial app, the wallet address would be available and no provider can **suspend** it.
