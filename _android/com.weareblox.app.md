## Analysis 

- We were not able to install the app due to geo-restriction to the Dutch market.
- The provider makes use of [cold-wallets](https://weareblox.com/nl-nl/blox-veilig) and multi-signature technology. But deposits are [limited](https://support.weareblox.com/hc/nl/articles/15528490826897-Waarom-kan-ik-alleen-crypto-storten-via-een-exchange-wallet-) only to coins sourced from an exchange.
- It is possible to [deposit bitcoin](https://support.weareblox.com/hc/nl/articles/15541166454929-Hoe-stort-ik-crypto-op-mijn-BLOX-account-) to an account-linked wallet. 
- However, it is [not possible to withdraw cryptocurrencies](https://support.weareblox.com/hc/nl/articles/15541104513809-Waarom-kan-ik-geen-munten-opnemen-) as part of the site's security measures.
- [Withdrawal](https://support.weareblox.com/hc/nl/articles/12394906908561-Hoe-kan-ik-geld-opnemen-uit-de-BLOX-app-) is in fiat via IBAN.
- To summarize, this app can receive bitcoins but only from exchanges. It disallows cryptocurrency withdrawals. It only allows fiat withdrawals. Finally, it uses cold-storage to secure the coins. Although it can obviously **receive** coins, the appropriate verdict is that it **cannot send/receive**. It functions very much like a CFD trading platform minus the CFDs. This app was made purely for speculative purposes, allowing the user to withdraw fiat.
