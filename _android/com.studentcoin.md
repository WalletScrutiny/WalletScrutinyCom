Its [homepage](https://studentcoin.org) description reads:

> Student Coin is the first crypto platform that allows users to easily design, create, and manage personal, start-up, NFT, and DeFi tokens.

From its [getting started page](https://docs.studentcoin.org/):

> The aim of the project is to put the tokens and blockchain into the mainstream- Student Coin is a first platform that allows to perform the wide-scale tokenization for people, organizations, corporations, startups and decentralized finances (DeFi).

We downloaded the app and it seemed that a BTC wallet is among the options. However, as of September 10, 2021, tapping on "BTC" does not elicit any response. We reached out to their Telegram Support and confirmed this information:

Thank you for this information. So as I understand it, depositing BTC is not yet <br>possible via the app. May I know if that information is accurate? @dihari<br><br>

Correct, it can only be possible once we have a full version app. 

On another note, we were messaged in private from an account that claims to be from Student Coin support. The account in question provided a BTC address for us to deposit to when we asked how to create a BTC wallet. 

Proceed with caution. 

Pending the release of their full version app, it is more prudent to say that this app **does not have a BTC wallet**.
