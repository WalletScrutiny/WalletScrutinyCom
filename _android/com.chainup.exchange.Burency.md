       Worst exchanger ever! Sometimes it fails to send email otp & sometimes fails to send phone number otp! This app is a joke! They don’t care about customer satisfaction! Worst application! Don’t download & use it!! Waste of time!

## Analysis

- This seems to be a cryptocurrency exchange.
- The website is down as of 2023-06-29 with Chinese characters at the top left of the screen.
- This appears on the site even if you used a VPN and TOR:

>  网络连接有误，请稍后重试

Translated:

> There was an error with the network connection, please try again later

- The app displays a similar error when we're trying to register:

> The business information is wrong. Please contact the administrator.

- There are many [allegations](https://twitter.com/search?q=burency%20scam) on twitter.
- There are no official announcements concerning the status of the website and the app. Both are simply not working.
- We'll mark this as **defunct** and **custodial** as some of the complaints indicated funds that are lost. The users also complained that they weren't able to log in.
