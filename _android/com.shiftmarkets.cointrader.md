## Analysis 

- Shiftmarkets is a general service provider which also offer the following services: 
  - Crypto Exchange Software 
  - Crypto Pay
  - Cryptocurrency Licensing and Regulation
  - NFT Solutions
  - Market Making Technology
  - Blockchain Integrations
- The [terms](https://exchange-demo.shiftmarkets.com/terms) that we agreed to when we were registering with the service was for a demo of their exchange.
- We noticed a discrepancy in their app when we went to the deposit segment. We were supposed to deposit BTC, but the app gave an address that started with a non-BTC standard character of 'm'. The notice text under the QR code also notifies the user to *"Send only Ethereum chain to this deposit address. Deposits sent from other networks will be lost."* This is incorrect since this has to be a BTC wallet. We [tweeted](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1694913991355883725) them about it.
- Moreover, the app seems to be preloaded with 20,000 XRP, 1 BTC, 10,000 USDT, 10,000 USD, 5 ETH, and 10 BCH. Perhaps this is a demo, but it was not made clear that this was a demo account. 
- Nevertheless, we found section 4.4 in their terms:
  > Cointrader securely stores all Digital Currency private keys in our control...

Although there was some initial confusion about the addresses and the lack of a designation that the initial account was a demo account, the terms make it clear that this is a **custodial** provider with a **non-verifiable** app.
