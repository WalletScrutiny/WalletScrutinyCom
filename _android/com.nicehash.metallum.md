## Verdict

After account registration and verification, various cryptocurrency wallets are available. None of them provide an option for backing up via seed phrases. 

According to the [Terms and Conditions](https://www.nicehash.com/legal-privacy/terms)

> NiceWallet means a wallet created automatically for the Account holder and provided by the NiceWallet provider. NiceHash does not hold funds on behalf of the Account holder but only transfers Account holder’s requests regarding the NiceWallet transaction to the NiceWallet provider who executes the requested transactions. In this respect NiceHash only processes and performs administrative services related to the payments regarding the NiceHash Mining Services. 
>
> NiceWallet provider is a third party which on the behalf of the Account holder provides and manages the NiceWallet, holds, stores and transfers funds and hosts NiceWallet. For more information about the NiceWallet provider BitGo, see the following website: https://www.bitgo.com and for NiceWallet provider NICEX Ltd., see the following website: https://www.nicex.com. 

The wallet service component of NiceHash is a **custodial** service.
