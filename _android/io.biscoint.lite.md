## Updated Review 2023-04-05

There were some concerns raised about the similarity in name of 2 Android apps and 2 iOS apps: 

Notably: 

{% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.bitpreco.bitprecoAppAndroid' verdict='true' %}
{% include walletLink.html wallet='iphone/com.bitpreco.bitprecoApp' verdict='true' %}

and 

{% include walletLink.html wallet='android/io.biscoint.lite/' verdict='true' %}
{% include walletLink.html wallet='iphone/io.biscoint.lite/' verdict='true' %}

The two pairs are considered as seperate products from the same unifying entity, bity.com.br. 

As we can see from the homepage of [bity.com.br](https://www.bity.com.br/):

## App Description 

[Terms of Use](https://www.bity.com.br/terms/)

Nesta modalidade não são permitidos depósitos, transferências e/ou saques das CRIPTOMOEDAS da CARTEIRA VIRTUAL do USUÁRIO vinculada ao BISCOINT para uma CARTEIRA VIRTUAL (ou wallet) não vinculada ao BISCOINT, de modo que os depósitos, transferências e/ou saques somente serão permitidos e efetuados em moeda corrente nacional (reais) para a conta de titularidade do USUÁRIO cadastrado, sendo, portanto, obrigatória a venda das CRIPTOMOEDAs para a efetivação do resgate em reais, salvo se houver o envio de documentação completa nos moldes da cláusula 4.1.2 e desde que aprovada pela empresa.

Through the SERVICES provided by the SITE, Biscoint offers a platform for the purchase and sale of CRYPTOMOEDAS by the USER, transactions carried out by the USERS themselves, allowing them to negotiate directly with each other, without Biscoint participating in the contact, negotiation or effectiveness of these negotiations, characterizing Biscoint only as an intermediary of the negotiations.

## Analysis 

We were able to register and download the app with the following screenshots posted on twitter: 

- [Main Dashboard](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1631214515697389570)
- [BTC address generated](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1631214518578864128)
- [Verification requirement prior to withdrawal](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1631214512631320579)

What we understand so far: 

1. A Bitcoin wallet is provided within the account.
2. The primary purpose of which is to allow the user to buy and sell Bitcoin through the platform.
3. Withdrawal of crypto is permitted but only after KYC - possibly with the exception that the user passes KYC. Otherwise, withdrawal can only be in fiat.

> 4.3 "...deposits, transfers and / or withdrawals will only be allowed and made in national currency ( real ) for the registered USER's ownership account, being, therefore, the sale of CRIPTOMOEDAs is mandatory for the realization of the redemption in reais, unless complete documentation is sent in accordance with clause 4.1.2 and provided it is approved by the company..."

The presence of a BTC wallet with an auto-generated QR code within a platform makes us believe that this is a **custodial** service with high-level of control over the funds of the users. However, section 4.3 complicates things for us as it indicates that the provider will only allow deposits, transfers and / or withdrawals in the Brazilian national currency - except complete documentation is sent. 

If the translation is accurate, then this means without KYC, the platform disallows sending and receiving bitcoins. After KYC, the platform may possibly allow it. 

We went on [twitter to clarify the matter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1631216074879545344). 

Tentatively, we will label this service as a platform that **does not allow sending and receiving of Bitcoins**.
