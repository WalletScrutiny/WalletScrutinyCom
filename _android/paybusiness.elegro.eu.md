## Analysis

- The website indicates that it supports BTC.

> With the Elegro Wallet, you can deposit, transfer, and withdraw funds in UAH, EUR, USD, GBP, BTC, BCH, ETH, LTC, USDC, USDT (Tron, TRC20). 

- According to the platform's Wallet Terms: 

> 4. Verification Process
>
> a. Before processing any payout requests, clients may be required to undergo additional verification steps for security purposes, such as liveness verification and/or video calls with a KYC specialist.
>
> b. Failure to complete the verification process may result in delays or denial of payout requests

We were not able to find any mention of cryptocurrency terms such as private keys, seeds or custodial third-party partners. The sign up the process alone should be enough to indicate that this is a custodial service.

- Users must "apply" for an account where they will be made to submit KYC information, and on the basis of the provider's decision - reject or approve such an application. 
- Provider can suspend or terminate the user's account which includes the cryptocurrencies in that account. 

This is a **custodial** service.
