## [Termination, Suspension and Closure of Account in Terms and Conditions](https://cointopay.com/terms)

> We shall have a right to suspend or restrict the provision of our Services and/or suspend fulfilment of concluded Virtual (Currency) Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement and/or repudiate from concluded Virtual (Currency) Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement and/or refuse to complete, block or reverse a transaction initiated by you (even when funds are already debited), or terminate these General Terms unilaterally (without applying to court) where so required by legal acts and/or by any competent authority(-ies) with jurisdiction over our activities. The relevant measure shall be applied within a period established under such legal acts or established by the relevant competent authority(-ies). In case such legal acts and/or supervisory authority does not specify a relevant period, then a relevant period shall be determined at our own discretion.

## The App

We were not able to register because of an error that we posted on a [screenshot on Twitter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1459088647949410306) 

We signed in via the web app. There was no mention of the private keys, seeds, or mnemonic. We could not find options pertaining to those.

## Verdict

A service that can "refuse to complete, block or reverse a transaction initiated" by the user, is markedly **custodial**. This makes the app **not verifiable**.
