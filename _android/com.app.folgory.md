## Analysis 

- [(Screenshots)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1656494533981663232)
- The associated website for the app has been down for 1 year already.
- Prior to that, archive.org lists several archived entries for the previous 4 years.  
- We tried to install the app, but it only had an option for logging in - with no 'Register' or "Sign Up" option. 
- With no social media accounts listed, and with a domain that is no longer online, we think that any email would be bounced back to us. 
- These factors, together with the allegations and the fact that the app was last updated in 2019, lend us to believe that this app is already **defunct.**
