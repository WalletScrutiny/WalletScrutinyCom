## App Description from Google Play 

> Verto is a multi-currency wallet that will allow access to the VDEX. Verto will also have integrative functionality of other DApps like order book settlement from VDEX and a crypto ratings and rankings dashboard from Vespucci.

## Analysis 

- We installed the app but **could not find a BTC wallet.** 
- We clicked on 'Trade VTX' and it led to a site called STEX, which had this statement on its site: 

> Force Majeure statement
>
> Due unrecognized factors we suffered data loss. In result we have very fragmented and non-consistent data about balances, transactions, etc. We cannot continue any business operations.
>
> To try to recover any accesable assets we kindly asking for your help - please send any related information about your transactions and account to recovery@stex.com.
