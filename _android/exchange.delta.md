## App Description

By all indications, this app looks like a centralized cryptocurrency exchange.

Self-described on Google Play:

> Delta Exchange is a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange. Users can trade (long/short) perpetual swaps, futures and options on Bitcoin, Ether, Ripple, DeFi, & 70+ tokens and cryptocurrencies.

It also features Robo Trading.

## The Site

The Site's [Terms of Use](https://www.delta.exchange/terms-of-use) has clear language about the termination of accounts.

> Suspension or Termination of Services and Account: We may, at Our discretion and without liability to You, with or without prior notice and at any time, temporarily suspend or permanently terminate Your access to all or a portion of any Services.

Apart from identity verification, the site also mandates a **screening process**.

## The App

We downloaded the app and registered. Once we have confirmed the OTP, we are brought to the app's main interface. The function to 'Deposit' is marked by a blue button. We then selected 'BTC' as the coin and a wallet address is generated. Withdrawal is also available.

## Verdict

We have sufficient reason to believe that the app is custodial primarily due to _1. its nature as an exchange, 2. its regulatory compliances including identity verification, 3. provisions in its [Terms of Use](https://www.delta.exchange/terms-of-use) concerning the unilateral termination of user accounts and subsequent freezing of funds._

Verdict is **custodial** and thus, **not verifiable**
