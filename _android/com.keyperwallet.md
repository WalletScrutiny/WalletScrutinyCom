## Analysis 

- Note that the previous meta-verdict for this app was 'obsolete'
- It was last updated in 2020.
- We installed the app in BlueStacks 5 Android Pie. 
- Whilst selecting from the Country List of phone numbers, we received an error: 

> Alert 
>
> Undefined

- We will email them at their email address at aj@keyper.global and admin@keyper.global
- The site is in Korean so there may be translation concerns. However, we did find references to a mnemonic phrase
- Until such time we could test the app, we'll leave this as a **work-in-progress.**
