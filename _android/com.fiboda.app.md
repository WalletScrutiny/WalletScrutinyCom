## App Description

> FIBODA is a leading multi-broker, Social, and Copy-trading Platform. Invest by copy trading with Top and curated Traders in Forex, Indices, Commodities, **Stock & Cryptos CFDs!**

FIBODA supports the buying and selling of CFDs, which means that users don't actually own the assets.

## The Site

From the Terms of Service:

> Fiboda offers solely the technical means that enable you to adopt trading strategies of other users of the Platform, based on the assumption that you have consciously chosen to conduct **CFD and/or FX transactions with a Broker of your choice.**

There's little to read in this site concerning cryptocurrencies.

## Verdict

Due to this platform being created for traders who conduct CFD transactions, users do not own the digital assets. This app **does not allow users to send or receive** bitcoins.
