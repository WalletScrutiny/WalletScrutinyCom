## App Description from Google Play

> Vesto provides an easy-to-use yet powerful gateway into the cryptocurrency ecosystem, transforming how organizations and individuals transact business, store and transfer digitized assets, and earn money. With a single secure sign-on using multi-sig encryption keys, users can deposit assets into a smart vWallet, exchange and transfer assets to and from that vWallet, and access DeFi, all at a small fraction of previous costs and taking only seconds to complete.

## Analysis 

The provider states this in the homepage:
  > Vestoâ€™s VWallet is a non-custodial smart wallet which can hold a wide range of digital assets. While Vesto provides custodial governance, multi-sig access controls, and administrative services, customers own their VWallet account and retain unique private keys, giving them complete and sole control over their assets deposited with Vesto.

- After we installed the app, a server maintenance screen appeared. This barred us from examining it further.
- Assuming that the app does provide the private keys to the user, they make no claims regarding source-availability. 
- We searched for the app ID on GitHub code, and only found [2 references](https://github.com/search?q=io.vesto.app&type=code) to the app. Both of which came from WalletScrutiny. 
- This app is **not source-available**.
