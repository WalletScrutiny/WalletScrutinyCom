**Update 2024-09-06:**

**Review: AquaWallet APK Build**

We followed the AquaWallet build instructions outlined in the repository, using Docker to create the build environment. Despite attempting various fixes, we encountered a critical issue preventing the successful build of the APK.

**Steps Taken:**
1. **Created Dockerfile:** Drafted a Dockerfile based on the repository's build instructions to set up the required environment.
2. **Ran Docker Build Command:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t aqua -f aqua.dockerfile .
   ```
3. **Encountered Error:**
   During the build process, the following error was encountered:
   ```
   aqua.dockerfile:17
   --------------------
     15 |     
     16 |     # Run 'make setup' to pull all dependencies and pre-built binaries for GDK and boltz-rust
     17 | >>> RUN nix develop --experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' --command /bin/bash -c "make setup"
     18 |     
     19 |     # Build the APK
   --------------------
   ERROR: failed to solve: process "/bin/sh -c nix develop --experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' --command /bin/bash -c \"make setup\"" did not complete successfully: exit code: 127
   ```
   This error indicates that the command failed to execute due to missing dependencies or an issue with Nix's experimental features. The `make setup` command, essential for pulling all necessary dependencies and binaries, could not be completed.

4. **Troubleshooting Steps:**
   - **Verified Bash Installation:** Confirmed that `/bin/bash` was properly installed in the Docker environment to ensure compatibility with the `make` command.
   - **Rechecked Nix Configurations:** Made sure the `nix develop` command used the correct syntax and experimental features (`nix-command` and `flakes`).
   - **Reviewed Dockerfile:** Examined the Dockerfile for any missing dependencies or misconfigurations that might be causing the build to fail.
   - **Tested Environment with Additional Tools:** Attempted installing necessary Nix packages directly but encountered further issues with missing binaries and dependencies for `flutter`, `gdk`, and `boltz-rust`.

**Conclusion:**

Despite several adjustments and thorough troubleshooting, the build process for AquaWallet's APK failed due to issues in the Nix development environment and missing dependencies during the `make setup` stage. We have reported this issue to the development team for further guidance. As of now, the APK remains **not verifiable** until these build issues are resolved.
