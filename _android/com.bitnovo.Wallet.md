**Note:** There are two BitNovo apps on Google Play. Both are by the same developer: [Bitnovo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=BITNOVO)

Apparently, com.bitnovo.Wallet is the [updated version](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1463081586539188225) of com.bitnovo.app which had this verdict:

{% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.bitnovo.app' verdict='true' %}

## App Description

The app allows users to buy, store, send, and trade cryptocurrencies. It also allows users to redeem vouchers.

## Google Play Critical reviews

Most of the 1-star reviews were about the redemption of the vouchers.

       Useless. Cant redeem my voucher

## The App

The app starts out with the option allowing the user to recover a wallet. It asked for a 12-word seed phrase. 

We used the seeds for the wallet we generated with:

{% include walletLink.html wallet='android/org.artr.wallet' verdict='true' %}

We were successful in importing the wallet. 

### The Vouchers and Cards Feature

Bitnovo also offers Vouchers and Cards, that require registering with the service.

## Verdict

This self-custodial app does not claim to be an open source project on its website. We were not able to locate a link to the source code on their webpage. Searching Github for the appID 'com.bitnovo.Wallet' also [did not yield any results](https://github.com/search?q=com.bitnovo.Wallet&type=code).
