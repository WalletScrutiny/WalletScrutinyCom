       I wish you had a disclaimer on the App Store etc that lists or indicates that it is not yet available in certain countries. You indicate that ££ GBP is available etc but you do not allow it to be used in UK. What a waste of time. I've now downloaded an app to my phone and provided my info yet cannot finalise the registration of use the app

## Analysis 

- We downloaded the app and tried signing up, but the app kept telling us that *"User name is not available"*. We even tried random letters and numbers, and we still couldn't sign up. We confirmed this on two devices.
- The Google Play text seems to describe a hardware wallet and a software wallet. But it isn't definitely clear since it described both items in the same sentence. The next step for us would be to look at its Help pages, if available.
- This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0qdWYxw-3o) shows us that the app supports multi-currency wallets.
- Scallop offers a complex service which integrates hardware wallets, crypto wallets, IBAN accounts, debit cards, fiat on and off-ramps, and hardware wallets. 
- You can find a more specific overview of all its services on this [page](https://learn.scallopx.com/scallop/what-is-scallop)
- We did not see any tutorial on how to use the app to secure the user's private keys. 
- Then we see this:
  > Hardware wallet - Store and trade your crypto using Scallop cold wallets, Scallop cold/hot storage are insured by our partners against loss by up to $100 million
- With no access to this closed system that is restricted to a specific geography, we can only base our analysis on the available information - or its absence. Noticeably absent are any tutorials regarding [mnemonic phrase in its 'learn' portal.](https://learn.scallopx.com/scallop/what-is-scallop?q=mnemonic). 
- Based on this we can then describe this particular app as a **custodial** service, and is therefore **non-verifiable**.
