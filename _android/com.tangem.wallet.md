**Update 2024-08-20** 

I messaged them on [x.com](https://x.com/dannybuntu/status/1825809273320063101) and on [reddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tangem/comments/1ewqdcn/im_trying_to_build_the_tangem_android_app_is/)

They [responded via x](https://x.com/Tangem/status/1825811448079024451) but want to collaborate via email. 

**Update 2024-08-19**: After a while, we saw it fit to retry the build to assuage the concerns of some that it is indeed source-available. 

So I begin with a basic docker template with some basic dependencies, with the cloning and building portions commented out.

```
# Use an official image as a base
FROM ubuntu:22.04

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    openjdk-11-jdk \
    curl \
    wget \
    git \
    unzip \

    lib32z1 \
    gradle \
    && apt-get clean

ENV GRADLE_USER_HOME=/opt/gradle

# Download and install Android SDK command line tools
RUN mkdir -p $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/cmdline-tools && \
    wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/commandlinetools-linux-9477386_latest.zip -O sdk-tools.zip && \
    unzip sdk-tools.zip -d $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/cmdline-tools && \
    mv $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/cmdline-tools/cmdline-tools $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/cmdline-tools/latest && \
    rm sdk-tools.zip

# Set up Android SDK
RUN yes | sdkmanager --licenses && \
    sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-31" "build-tools;31.0.0"

# Clone the Tangem Android app repository
WORKDIR /workspace
# RUN git clone https://github.com/tangem/tangem-app-android.git .

# Update submodules to use HTTPS instead of SSH
# RUN sed -i 's/git@github.com:/https:\/\/github.com\//g' .gitmodules

# Initialize and update submodules
# RUN git submodule init && git submodule update

# Build the app
# RUN ./gradlew clean assembleDebug

# Set entrypoint for manual build
CMD ["/bin/bash"]
```

### Clone the repository

```

### Checkout to hotfix/5.13.1 and then update submodules

Tangem's releases and tags are not updated regularly. Instead they have branches which is where their most recent updates are made.

```
root@0247199e5fcb:/workspace# cd tangem-app-android/
root@0247199e5fcb:/workspace/tangem-app-android# git checkout hotfix/5.13.1
Branch 'hotfix/5.13.1' set up to track remote branch 'hotfix/5.13.1' from 'origin'.
Switched to a new branch 'hotfix/5.13.1'
root@0247199e5fcb:/workspace/tangem-app-android# git submodule init

root@0247199e5fcb:/workspace/tangem-app-android#
```

### git submodule update --init --recursive

```

Like in the previous review, this failure is indicative of a private repository/submodule (or nonexistent one). This means that the project is **not source-available**, or more completely, not 100% available. Since the build step fails very near to the part where we clone the repository, a failure in this shouldn't be considered a failure to build, since we've barely begun the build process.

## Previous Review 2024-02-09
Yes, there is a repository but it has neither
documentation nor an issue tracker to ask how to build it. But it doesn't look
too complicated. Let's see how it goes ...

`v5.5.1` is the currently available version on Google Play.

```
root@a05bfbe4d44c:/mnt# apt update
root@a05bfbe4d44c:/mnt# apt full-upgrade -y
root@a05bfbe4d44c:/mnt# git clone https://github.com/tangem/tangem-app-android
root@a05bfbe4d44c:/mnt# cd tangem-app-android/
root@a05bfbe4d44c:/mnt/tangem-app-android# git tag | grep '5\.'
4.5.1
root@a05bfbe4d44c:/mnt/tangem-app-android# git branch --all | grep '5\.5\.1'
  remotes/origin/5.5.1_pre_release
  remotes/origin/hotfix/5.5.1
  remotes/origin/merge/hotfix_5.5.1_to_release
```

So there is something about a `v5.5.1` release but it's not tagged correctly.
Is the app configured to be version `5.5.1`?

```
root@a05bfbe4d44c:/mnt/tangem-app-android# rgrep '5\.5\.1' .
./.git/packed-refs:a40b26faa3a13d82d40a81574391ebc0afad2390 refs/remotes/origin/5.5.1_pre_release
./.git/packed-refs:23d54ea5894c630ef36e020520d4a5e6f0eb0dcf refs/remotes/origin/hotfix/5.5.1
./.git/packed-refs:05a4b8af12e9bd7b4f9497e84db47961bff8ab4a refs/remotes/origin/merge/hotfix_5.5.1_to_release
```

Not really.

Can we compile the app? We see it has git submodules. Let's get those, first:

```
root@a05bfbe4d44c:/mnt/tangem-app-android# git submodule update --init --recursive
Cloning into '/mnt/tangem-app-android/app/src/main/assets/tangem-app-config'...

```

It fails to clone from `git@github.com:tangem/tangem-app-config.git`. As it
turns out this is a private repository. So while the name suggest it's only some
configuration, we cannot verify that. This project is **not verifiable**.

Sadly we cannot file an issue with them but we will try to reach them on social
media.
