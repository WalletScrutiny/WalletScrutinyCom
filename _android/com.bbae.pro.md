## Analysis 

- BBAE seems to have [scrubbed](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1648969152420524033) the word 'Crypto' from its web assets. However, this is still reflected on Google search results. Clicking on the link, does not show the current text however. For example: 
- An explanation comes from the fact that Bakkt has acquired Apex Crypto.
- Apex Crypto LLC's website features the splash announcement linking to [Bakkt](https://bakkt.com/newsroom/bakkt-completes-acquisition-of-apex-crypto)
- When conducting a Google search, Apex Crypto's role in BBAE is defined in [(Screenshot)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1648969152420524033): 
> Cryptocurrency trading on the BBAE platform is serviced by BBAE Crypto LLC and offered through APEX Crypto LLC, neither of which are FINRA members.

- It would appear that this service used to be custodial. But this has undergone some changes when Apex Crypto, LLC., was acquired by Bakkt. Now the word 'crypto' or any clue to 'cryptocurrency' related services, seems to have been removed from their website.

We reached out to them to verify this. While we wait for their response, we'll mark this as a work-in-progress.
