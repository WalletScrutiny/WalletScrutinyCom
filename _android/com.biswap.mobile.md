## App Description from Google Play

  > Biswap - Swap, earn, and build on the leading decentralized crypto trading protocol.
  > Based on high performance public blockchain - FAB, it's fast and trustworthy.

## Analysis 

- The 12-word seed phrases were presented when the app started. 
- There is a legacy BTC address that can send/receive. 
- The option to show the mnemonic is also available in the settings.
- The project claims to be an Open Source decentralized project.
  - Searching for the app ID in GitHub code, leads us to this [repository](https://github.com/blockchaingate/biswap). 
  - It is described as: 
    > A protocol for liquidity provision that supports BTC, ETH and all ERC-20 tokens, LTC, BCH, FAB and al
  - There are no releases, and no description if it's an Android app or such. The latest version of {{ page.title }} is 1.0.13, which was released on 2023-07-18. 
- Although the project claims to be source-available, it has not made sufficient descriptions in its repository nor has it made any direct links to the repository for the Android app. 
- For now, we will label this as a project that is **not source-available**, until this is rectified. We filed an [issue](https://github.com/blockchaingate/biswap/issues/1) in their repository informing them of this.
