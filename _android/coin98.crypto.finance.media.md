The [Coin98 website](https://coin98.app/) claims to be a wallet from their description...

> Coin98 Wallet is the simplest and most secure crypto & bitcoin wallet to store, send, receive and manage your crypto assets, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), TomoChain (TOMO), Ethereum-based ERC20 tokens. etc.

so it claims to manage BTC, it also claims users are in control of their private keys, hence the wallet claim of being non-custodial

> Taking full control of your assets with Biometric Authentication and Private Keys: managed by you, none of your personal data collected by the App.

with no source code repository listed or found...

Our verdict: This 'wallet' claims to be non-custodial but does not provide public source and therefore is **not verifiable**.
