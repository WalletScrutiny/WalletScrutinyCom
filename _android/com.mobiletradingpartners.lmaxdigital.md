## Note

It's unclear how exactly this app is related to LMAX, as it isn't linked on the website. The official site links to a different app: {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.mobiletradingpartners.lmax' verdict='true' %}. Both apps have different [Google](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=LMAX+BROKER+LIMITED) [Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=LMAX+DIGITAL+EXCHANGE+LIMITED) developers.

## Verdict

We could not find any proof that you could deposit Bitcoin on the platform. Deposits are made in fiat. [Withdrawals can only be in fiat.](https://www.lmax.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/Terms-of-Business.pdf)

Financial trading platforms that support crypto CFDs usually **do not allow deposits or withdrawals in cryptocurrency.** These services are necessarily **custodial** which makes the app **unverifiable**.
