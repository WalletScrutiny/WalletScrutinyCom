## Updated Verdict 

Based on information from lmaxdigital.com, it is possible to send and receive BTC from the app. However, it is **custodial** as described in the [Terms of Business:](https://www.lmaxdigital.com/documents/LMAXDigital-Terms-of-Business.pdf) 

> **Funding your LMAX Digital Account.** 
> 
> In order to complete an order, you must first deposit funds in to your LMAX Digital Account. You may be required to verify that the bank account or digital wallet that you use to deposit funds from belongs to you. You may be charged fees
by your bank or digital wallet provider. LMAX Digital is not responsible for any such fees.
>
> **11.2 About Funds Held in Your LMAX Digital Account.** Proceeds from the sale of Digital Currency will be credited to your LMAX Digital Account, less any transactional or other fees.
>
> **11.3 Rejected Transactions**. In some cases, your bank or digital wallet provider may reject the funds or Digital Currency that we send to it. You agree that you will not hold LMAX Digital liable for any damages resulting from such rejected transactions.
>
> **11.4 Digital Currency Trades.** LMAX Digital cannot reverse a Digital Currency Contract which has been broadcast to a Digital Currency network. You cannot cancel, reverse, or amend any transaction marked as complete or pending.
>
> **11.5 Digital Currency Storage.** LMAX Digital securely stores all Digital Currency private keys in our control in a combination of online and offline storage.

## Previous Analysis

### Note

It's unclear how exactly this app is related to LMAX, as it isn't linked on the website. The official site links to a different app: {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.mobiletradingpartners.lmax' verdict='true' %}. Both apps have different [Google](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=LMAX+BROKER+LIMITED) [Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=LMAX+DIGITAL+EXCHANGE+LIMITED) developers.

## App Description

> Provide access to the LMAX Digital central limit order book streaming firm, deep liquidity for the most liquid crypto currencies: BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH and XRP (all against USD, EUR & JPY)

## The Site

They have a live Crypto CFD ticker with the following pairs, and more:

- XBTUSD
- XBTJPY
- XRPUSD
- XRPJPY

## The App

You cannot login until you apply for an account with LMAX Global. They have to approve it.

> [They require users to verify](https://www.lmax.com/global/account-faqs) identity and country of residency. If you are an individual and a resident of the UK, Sweden, Germany or Canada, the details you submit will be checked by a third party credit agency.

> All LMAX Global clients have access to our liquidity pools in London, New York and Tokyo and are able to trade over 100 instruments: FX, metals, equity indices, commodities and crypto CFDs:

> How do I fund my account?
> LMAX Global UK
> We currently offer accounts denominated in GBP, EUR, USD, AUD, CHF, JPY, PLN, SEK, SGD, HKD and HUF. We accept funds via bank transfer and debit/credit card.
>
> LMAX Global EU
> We offer accounts denominated in GBP, EUR, USD. Currently we only accept funds via bank transfer.

> LMAX Global NZ
> We offer accounts denominated in AUD, EUR, GBP and USD. We accept funds via bank transfer, debit/credit card, Skrill and Neteller.

## Verdict

We could not find any proof that you could deposit Bitcoin on the platform. Deposits are made in fiat. [Withdrawals can only be in fiat.](https://www.lmax.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/Terms-of-Business.pdf)

Financial trading platforms that support crypto CFDs usually **do not allow deposits or withdrawals in cryptocurrency.** These services are necessarily **custodial** which makes the app **unverifiable**.
