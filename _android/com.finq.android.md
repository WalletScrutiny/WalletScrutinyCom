Trading CFDs (Contract for Difference) has never been more popular as a preferred method of investment. You don’t have to buy a share or a Bitcoin or a gold bar, instead you trade on the underlying asset as it moves up and down in the market.

This platform only allows getting exposure to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies but **not to send or receive bitcoins**. Deposits and withdrawals are in fiat. 

The types of trading accounts are listed on this [page.](https://www.finq.com/en/trading-accounts)
