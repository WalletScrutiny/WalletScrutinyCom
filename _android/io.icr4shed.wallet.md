## The App

Upon opening the app, the options were: "Create a New Wallet", "Watch" and "Import". Once we were able to copy the backup, we then proceeded to the home page of the app. There doesn't seem to be [BTC support for this app. (twitter screenshot)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1457966263779553281)

## Verdict

With no website, a generic sounding app name and no social media accounts, this app does **not have support for BTC** despite claims in its Google Play page.
