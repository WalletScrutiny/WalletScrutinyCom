## App Description from Google Play 

> Alterdice is a comprehensive financial platform for the majority of leading cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, XRP, NEO and + 45 more coins.

### [Security](https://alterdice.com/page/security)

> Cryptocurrency repository
>
> Majority of digital assets in the system are stored in stand-alone “cold” wallets. Only about 0.5% of the cryptoactives are in “hot” wallets for use in everyday operations. To ensure a high level of security, you cannot get an access to the “cold” wallets from the platform itself and its servers. The right to manual access to the funds in the autonomous “cold” wallets is only granted to a few chief administrators.

## Analysis 

- [(Screenshots)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1656248209449312256)
- As the Security page states, majority of digital assets in the system are stored in stand-alone "cold" wallets. 
- This is evidently a **custodial** platform.
