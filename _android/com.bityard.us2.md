### [Terms of Use](https://support.bityard.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039273852-Terms-of-Use)

**Section 17. Termination of the Terms of Use**

> BitYard may, by giving notice, at its sole discretion **terminate the User’s access to the Platform and to the User’s Account, including without limitation, BitYard right to: limit, suspend or terminate the Services and the Users’ Accounts, prohibit access to the Services**, delay or remove hosted content and take technical and legal steps to keep the Users off the Platform, with or without cause.

## Verdict

This is a cryptocurrency exchange with KYC, termination clauses that bar access to the service and therefore it is **custodial** and  **cannot be verified.**
