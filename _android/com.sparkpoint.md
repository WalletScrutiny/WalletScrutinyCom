It has a standard description introducing the wallet's purpose:

> Unlock the SparkPoint Ecosystem with our official crypto wallet app.
Send, receive, and store BTC, ETH, SRK, SFUEL, other ERC-20 & BEP-20 tokens and your NFTs with ease & confidence.

It also claims to be "100% non-custodial".

**The reviews are brutal!!** Read the scam accusations and consider that
positive ratings might be bought! This amount of accusations is not normal!

We were not able to find the source code nor any references to its availability and conclude the app is **not verifiable**.
