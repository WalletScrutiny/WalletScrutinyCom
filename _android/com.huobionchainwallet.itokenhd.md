## Analysis 

We were not able to install the app due to country restrictions. Its iPhone counterpart is also unavailable now.

If we are going to take the description at face-value, then this app:

1. Is self-custodial
2. Supports Bitcoin

However, we [did not find](https://github.com/search?q=com.huobionchainwallet.itokenhd&type=code) any pertinent repository or code that would show that this app is source-available. 

Thus, we make the conclusion that this app is **not source-available**.
