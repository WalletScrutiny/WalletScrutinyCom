## Analysis 

We registered with the app and made the following findings:

- We can send and receive BTC 
- We were not provided with the seed phrases 

Although there is nothing in its description, documentation and website to indicate that {{ page.title }} is a custodial provider, the non-provisioning of private keys is a strong indicator of a **custodial** service. 

We reached out to Zyth's official [twitter account](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1653680514770046977) to clarify this matter, but for the meantime, we believe that we have enough to judge this product as **custodial**.
