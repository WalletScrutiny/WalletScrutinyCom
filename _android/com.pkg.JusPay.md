## Analysis 

- The primary website juspay.app is no longer online
- There was only one archive [entry](https://web.archive.org/web/20211206042715/http://juspay.app/) for the site, a parked page.
- We were asked to provide a pin
- We were then provided the mnemonic phrase 
- After the mnemonic phrase was shown, there was only a blank screen. 
- Considering the status written in the description, (Wallet Under Development), the last update (2020), the non-working app and the offline website, this app is most probably **defunct**.
