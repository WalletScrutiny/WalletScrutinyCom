The Google Play description: 

> ONTO is the first truly decentralized, cross-chain wallet, allowing users to securely manage their identities, data, and digital assets.

Given that it refers to itself as a **decentralized** wallet, this likely means that it is a **self-custodial** wallet. As our policy is "don't trust, verify" we will still try to verify this.

In the official website's help center, [we find a page on how to export ONT ID Wallet](https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/onto/guides/wallet-management/wallet-backup).

Users may choose to export their 12-word mnemonic phrase. [It is also possible to import and export single-chain wallets](https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/onto/guides/wallet-management/import-export-switch-or-delete-single-chain-wallet#import-single-chain-wallet) provided the users have access to the mnemonic phrases.

We emailed them to verify the location for the source code of their wallet, and they have pointed to the [github](https://github.com/ONTO-Data-Wallet) page at the bottom of their site.

We took a look at ONTO's github page for the source code corresponding to their Google Play appID, but have found no results. The link points to the "ONTO-Data-Wallet". Curiously, at the time of this writing, the page only contained a readme file. 

In the absence of a scrutinizable source code, we would tentatively have to label this as having **no source code**.
