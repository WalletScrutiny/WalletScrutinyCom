## App Description from Google Play

> Metaegg DeFi wallet engineered to serve the needs of certain people. If you're looking for a plain way to store Bitcoin or some crypto this app might not be for you.
>
> This wallet app is purposely built as a decentralized asset management tool for cryptocurrencies that are immune to inflation, confiscation, or censorship. It packs features designed to onboard investment-oriented individuals into a crypto ecosystem without headaches.

## Analysis 

- A 12-word seed phrase was provided
- There was a bitcoin wallet with a SegWit address
- They claim to be a fully Open Source project. 
- We checked the website listed in its Google Play profile, but it seems to point to a blog about Forex. 
- We searched GitHub for the app ID, but found [0 results.](https://github.com/search?q=io.metaegg.wallet&type=code)

There are several claims in the Google Play description that give us pause when examining the actual app. First, its claim to not support Bitcoin is false. Second, its claim to be fully Open Source, is also false. But with that said, this app is plainly **not source-available**.
