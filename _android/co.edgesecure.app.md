After prior reviews were
{% include verdictBadge.html verdict='ftbfs' type='short' %} and should actually
have been {% include verdictBadge.html verdict='nosource' type='short' %} for
the code of the latest release being published only after our review, this
wallet took a slight turn to the better:
Emanuel managed to at least build it but unfortunately
[the build result differed significantly](https://github.com/EdgeApp/edge-react-gui/issues/1748)
from what they publish via Play Store. This wallet is
**not verifiable**.
