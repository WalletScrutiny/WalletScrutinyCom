## App Description from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sixmultiverse.heartnumber&gl=us) 

> 1. HEART NUMBER offers predictions which are individualized to help with price prediction on Binance.
>
> 2. HEART NUMBER offers convenient trading and secretarial function not available on Binance.

## Analysis 

We downloaded the app. Tapping on 'Exchange' or 'Assets' with a wallet icon, leads to a screen which shows an API form connecting to BitThumb. [(Screenshots)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1645748469209112578). 'Wallet', meanwhile shows the following assets: 

- HTN 
- ETH 
- USDT 

## Verdict 

Although 'wallet' is often mentioned in the Terms and Conditions, accessible via the app, it **does not support Bitcoin**.
