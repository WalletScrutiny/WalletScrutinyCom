## The Site

[Withdrawal verification system](https://jp-ex.io/en/bulletin/116?)

> Update 1.2 Withdrawal verification system -To improve the security level of user assets, after the update, we need users to **pass "double confirmation" upon withdrawal, which must include "bind mobile" or "bind email address" among with "Google Verification Code"**. You need to enter the one-time verification code and Google verification code as required for each withdrawal, and the relevant withdrawal procedure will only be carried out after both verifications are passed.

## The App

We downloaded and registered. There are multiple cryptocurrency wallets that allow for deposit or withdrawals. Seeds or private-key backup options are not available. 

## Verdict

Like most exchanges, JPEX is a **custodial** service. This makes the app **not verifiable.**
