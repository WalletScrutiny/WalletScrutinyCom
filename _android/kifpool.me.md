## Analysis 

- We were not able to register due to the requirement of an Iranian number.
- The [terms](https://kifpool.me/terms) of the site indicate that the service may suspend or stop any transactions of any cryptocurrency at any time.
- The provider also refers to the wallet as a 'hosted wallet'
- The [currency withdrawal and deposit](https://kifpool.me/faq) section of the FAQ, gives us a hint of the custodial nature of this app. 
- For one, withdrawals need approval. 
- Changing the phone number in the profile section, requires submitting a short video to the provider. 
- We had difficulty analyzing this app, but believe that the terms was sufficient to describe a **custodial** service.
