## App Description

> Convenient and safe cryptocurrency exchange
> FX5 Exchange provides the most professional, secure and global cryptocurrency trading environment.
>
> FX5 is safe. We have built a world-class security system to protect our customers' assets.
**Most of our customers' assets are stored in an offline storage that cannot be attacked by external attacks,** and our customers' valuable assets are protected from hacking.

FX5 is a Korean trading platform. Here, the app description gives a good indication that it is a custodial service.

## The App

Trying out the app and registering reveals that we need to complete multiple levels of verification to be able to withdraw or deposit digital assets.

## Verdict

With the information gather this far and no mention of self-custody or private keys, we can conclude this app is **custodial** and thus **not verifiable.**
