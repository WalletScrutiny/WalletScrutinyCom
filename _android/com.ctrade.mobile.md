Found in the [Terms and Conditions page:](https://www.c-trade.com/en/terms)

>__12.3__ At any given time, at C-Trade’s sole discretion, C-Trade reserves the right to close your account without prior notice and any remaining assets will be transferred to you at the address on record.

### The App
We downloaded the app to test out its features. It is possible to deposit bitcoin, and the app will generate a BTC address. 

It is also possible to withdraw, though two-factor authentication is mandatory first.

### Verdict
This app is **custodial** and thus **not verifiable.**
