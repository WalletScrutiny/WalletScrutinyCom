       I deposited $38 but nothing shows up on my wallet. When I checked the transaction status from where i made the withdrawal (BINANCE) It says success. I just lost my money.

## Analysis 

- We received an error during registration:

     > Service is temporarily unavailable

- The app description from Google Play does inform us that it is a **custodial** service, and therefore **not-verifiable**.
