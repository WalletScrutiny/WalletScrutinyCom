There is another version of this app at: 

- {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/pro.cointr' verdict='true' %}
- {% include walletLink.html wallet='iphone/vip.trcoin.global' verdict='true' %}

- The 'Pro' version is targeted towards a global audience while this specific app is for Turkey. 
- We found a link to both platforms on an official [CoinTR support page](https://support.cointr.com/hc/tr/articles/6016900478095-CoinTR-PRO-da-TRY-Paritesi-Durdurulacakt%C4%B1r-).
- The website cointr.com, also links to the [CoinTRPro twitter account.](https://twitter.com/coinTRPro)
- Similarly, we can see the CoinTRTurkiye twitter account [linking to the Pro](https://twitter.com/CoinTRTurkiye/status/1692551931724743128) version of the app. 
- Finally, we see the cointr.pro website [links](https://support.cointr.pro/hc/en-us/articles/5236871136399) to the CoinTR app.
- Ultimately, the two link to each other.

## Analysis

- We registered with the platform and the security measures included:
  - Google Authenticator
  - Password 
  - Pattern Password
- There are also many security levels. 
- There is a Bitcoin wallet with withdraw and deposit functions. 
- There is a category for 'Frozen funds'.   
- There are multiple cryptocurrency pairs such as BTC/USDT 
- The [Terms](https://support.cointr.com/hc/tr/articles/5538297429903) have a termination cause that can be unilateral
- Section 4.26 also indicates that the platform reserves the power to monitor all transactions. 
- All of these factor in to a **custodial** provider.
