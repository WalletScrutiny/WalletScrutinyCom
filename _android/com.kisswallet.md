This page was created by a script from the **appId** "com.kisswallet" and public
information found
[here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kisswallet).

Probably an engineer will soon have a deeper look at this app.

So far we are not even sure it is a wallet ... Please check back later.
