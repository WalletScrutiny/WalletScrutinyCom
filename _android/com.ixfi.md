## App Description from Google Play

> The IXFI platform supports over 500 cryptocurrencies and 1000 trading pairs

## Analysis

- The sign-up process consisted of email verification.
- The app then gave a 'Compliance check'
  - The first option verified whether we were acting on our own behalf and not for third-parties.
  - The second asked whether we were a politically exposed person.
- The app provides a multi-currency wallet with support for 2 BTC wallets: a SegWit wallet and a legacy wallet.
- The options available for the BTC wallet were:
  - Withdraw
  - Deposit
  - Trade
  - Swap
  - Convert
- The security options included: 2FA, SMS authentication, app lock and anti-phishing code. We did not find any option to backup the private keys. 
- The non-provisioning of the private keys makes this app a **custodial** wallet.
