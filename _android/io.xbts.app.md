## Analysis 

- [Video](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1698996435776319663)
- We were asked to input a pin code.
- From there we chose to "Create new account"
- Instead of a mnemonic phrase, we were presented with a password field that we had to copy.
- The app then clarified that our account at XBTS is our address in the BitShares Blockchain. We were enjoined to "save the passphrase issued by the blockchain during registration." 
- Also, "No one other than you holds your keys."
- There was a Bitcoin wallet.
- The assumption here is that the passphrase they provided contains an encrypted form of the private keys.
- The app's repository could be found [here](https://github.com/XBTS/app).

This app is **for verification**.
