## App Description from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sketch.wallet) 

> Sketch Wallet allows you to easily and safely manage various mainnet coins and tokens such as Sketchcoin, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Klaytn, Ripple, and EOS

## App Description from the App 

> SketchWallet stores cryptocurrency and can be used as a convenient payment method in conjunction with SketchPay. If you become an integrated member of SketchWallet, you can safely and conveniently manage your assets 

## Analysis 

- We were able to install the app but failed to register due to mobile carrier requirements. [(Screenshot)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1653650176173809665)

We did make some observations:
- The app provided 12-word seed phrases 
- The app description states that it supports BTC

At this juncture, we can hypothesize that this is a self-custodial wallet however it is **not source-available.** We could change our findings pending correspondence from the provider.
