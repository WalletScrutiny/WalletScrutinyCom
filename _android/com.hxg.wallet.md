## Analysis

- The app started off with the option to "Create Identity Wallet". A message was included which says, "The private keys never leave your device"
- It then presented us with a 12-word mnemonic. An option to select a 24-word mnemonic is present.
- We confirmed it, and it then asked us to provide a 6-digit numeric password.
- We looked for the BTC wallet and found a legacy address. Options to swap were also available.
- We searched for the app Id in [GitHub Code](https://github.com/search?q=com.hxg.wallet&type=code), but did not find anything.
- The provider also doesn't say whether the project was source-available or not. They do have a [GitHub organization account](https://github.com/web32023), but with sparse repositories.
- This app is **not source-available**.
