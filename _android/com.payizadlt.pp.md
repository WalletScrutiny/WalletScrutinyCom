              Complete scam!! Fraudster app!! Don't use it...
              
There are many suspicious 5* reviews and it is possible that some of them were bought. 

Another review says that the OTP never arrived.

## The Site

It's difficult to find verifiable sources of information on this site. The Privacy Policy page returns a 404 error and the site is small.

However, Payiza claims to have a wallet. It is described as:

> An eWallet system to store your funds and make payments to anyone in your network instantly and securely.

## The App

We tried to register. Although it asked to verify via SMS, we did not receive an OTP. We tried on multiple numbers.  

## Verdict

With little information on this app and an inability to register, we classify this app as **defunct.**
