## App Description 

> Relampago is an experimental wallet forked from https://lightning-wallet.com/.

## Analysis 

After installing the app, we are then asked to create a wallet or restore a wallet. 

We were not able to proceed as it says the wallet is in 'emergency mode'. 

This wallet is on its way to becoming defunct.
