## Updated Review and Verdict 2021-11-01

Upon installation, the app now displays a picture of a monkey with a crown. The heading is labeled 'Followiz'. We documented screenshots on [twitter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1455011267555516419/photo/1). Scrolling down, it then shows the following text:

> enviar pago
> para realizar un pago, envielo usando ios botones que aprecen a continuacion
>
> Para realizar un pago, envielo usando el codigo QR o ios botones que aparecen a continuacion

translated:

> send payment
> to make a payment, send it using the buttons you see next
>
>To make a payment, send it using the QR code or the buttons that appear next

Its lack of functionalities of a real "Bitcoin Wallet" as it calls itself make it highly suspicious.

## Old Review 2021-10-19

⚠️ **Caution**: this app does not have developer information apart from "Crypt Financial Services". It also did not list its 'Website' on Google Play. While these do not constitute in and of themselves evidence of any wrongdoing, it does raise questions about the app itself. We advise users to take extra precautionary measures when installing this app.   

## App Description

The logo of the app bears a striking resemblance to the original orange bitcoin app. Instead, it is blue.

The developer of the wallet is ["CryptWallet - Finance Services"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=%F0%9F%A5%87+CryptWallet+-+Finance+Services)

The Google Play description lists the following features for the app:

> ✔️ Visualization of the portfolio balance in Bitcoin and in other currencies.<br>
  ✔️ Sending and receiving bitcoins through NFC, QR codes or Bitcoin URL.<br>
  ✔️ Address book to store commonly used Bitcoin addresses.<br>
  ✔️ Transactions can be carried out offline, executing when the connection is recovered

       Awful!!! The only thing that works in this app is ads. It shows nothing at all.

       It will not let me in even when wifi is on

## The App

Once we opened the app, the first thing that appeared was a button that looks like a Paypal button. The label of the button was "Comprar Ahora" translated means, "Buy Now". At the bottom of the button are the logos for MasterCard, Visa, American Express and other cards.

We would not like to press that button.

## Old Verdict

⚠️ **Caution**. We believe that many of the circumstances regarding this app makes it prime for more scrutiny. In the absence of any proof that it is indeed a cryptocurrency wallet, our safest verdict would be to say that **it is not a bitcoin wallet.**
