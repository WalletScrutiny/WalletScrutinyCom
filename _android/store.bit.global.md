## App Description 

> Bit.Store is a Bitcoin investing app tailored for new and junior investors looking to buy Bitcoin in a fuss-free manner. App users can buy and sell Bitcoins at competitive prices in under 1 minute directly with local and international fiat payment channels including mobile wallets and bank transfer.

From its [Google Play page](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=store.bit.global).

## Analysis 

We signed up for an account. There were no provisions for backup seed phrases. Strangely, though the app clearly states that it is a "Bitcoin investing app", the "bitcoin" choices that are available when trying to deposit are TRC20 (TRON) or BEP20 (Binance Smart Chain)- which are not on the Bitcoin blockchain.

We could not find an option to deposit bitcoins from the Bitcoin blockchain.
