## App Description from Google Play

> - RockWallet’s multicurrency mobile wallet makes it quick and easy to buy, use, swap, and store top digital assets.
> - Registered with FinCEN as a Money Service Business (MSB). 
> - Compliant with all applicable regulations in all of our markets.
> - Built on the trusted BRD open-source codebase, the first and regarded most secure mobile crypto wallet.
> - Your RockWallet app is protected by your mobile device’s state-of-the-art security features.

## Analysis 

- This is a multi-currency wallet.
- We installed the app and were provided the seed phrases prior to email sign-up. 
- There was a BTC wallet with a legacy address.
- Users can opt to not sign up with the service. 
- The developers claim that this app was derived from {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.breadwallet' verdict='true' %} which was code-available in the past.
- They also claim to be source-available.
- We will put this app up [**for verification**](https://gitlab.com/walletscrutiny/walletScrutinyCom/-/issues/498).
