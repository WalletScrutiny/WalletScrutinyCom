## Analysis 

We tried to register with the service but were not able to receive the confirmation sms. 

The company is also a Bitcoin ATM provider operating mostly in the Czech region. 

Without access to the main app, we would have to pause this specific review until more information is available.

How to buy bitcoin using their Bitcoin ATM machine:

> HOW TO BUY BITCOIN AT BITCOIN ATM?
> At Bitcoinmat   click on „Buy bitcoin“, express your consent with the Trading Terms and scan the QR code with the bitcoin address where we will send the bitcoin. If you have no address, Bitcoin ATM will help you to set up the so-called „paper wallet“. Then, the only thing you have to do is to insert the bank-notes into the acceptor; you will see the amount of the inserted means on the display of the Bitcoin ATM. After you have inserted the demanded amount, click on „Buy bitcoin“. The purchase order will be executed within a few second, you will receive a confirmation and the things are done.

The paper wallet they recommend is bitaddress.org.

From this video and from the [FAQ](https://bit.plus/en-cz/faq), the provider is recommending other wallets. Therefore, this app **does not have a wallet**.
