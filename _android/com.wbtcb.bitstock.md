       Avoid. Send money and nothing. When I try to get cash says performijg verification forever....

## Analysis 

We tried to register with the service but were not able to receive the confirmation sms. 

The company is also a Bitcoin ATM provider operating mostly in the Czech region. 

Without access to the main app, we would have to pause this specific review until more information is available.
