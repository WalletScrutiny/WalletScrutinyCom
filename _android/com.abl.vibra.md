## Analysis 

- The app/service requires KYC to be able to access upgraded user tiers. 
- The app supports multiple cryptocurrencies and has an order book built-in where users can buy or sell cryptocurrencies. 
- It has exchange functionalities as well as a 'Savings' tab.
- We were not able to access any provision for creating backups or seeds for the Bitcoin wallet. 

We believe this service is custodial.
