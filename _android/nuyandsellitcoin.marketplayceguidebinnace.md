## Analysis

- This app looks like it is trying to look like the {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.binance.dev' verdict='true' %} app, but is doing a bad job of it. 
- The logo looks like the Binance diamond. The use of the word "Binance Free App" as the first phrase in the description seems to imply that it is Binance's "free app". 
- It hasn't done a good job of differentiating itself from the real app, so it still qualifies as a **fake.** We examined the app, and it is mostly educational material. But since Binance is a financial app, we'd still have to apply the fake label.
