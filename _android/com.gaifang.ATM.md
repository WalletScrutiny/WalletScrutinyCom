## [Terms and Conditions](https://atmoption.in/termsConditions)

Under Section 2, provision c. ii. b "Ancillary Services", number 1 i., ATM Option states that part of its Ancillary Services includes:

> 1. i. Safekeeping and administration of the Financial Instruments for the Client’s Trading Account, including custodianship and related services such as cash/collateral management.

Its Zendesk and support pages are no longer available.

Under Section 2.a - "Risks"

> The value of the Financial Instruments offered by the Company may increase or decrease. The Client acknowledges that they fully understand the risks involved in trading CFDs (and other similar products), including, but not limited to, the risk of loss of all funds.

## The App

We downloaded the app and it only asked for a phone number and SMS verification. Once we're using the app, the options were "Buy" and "Sell" Bitcoin under the CFD tab. Deposit and Withdrawal can only be done via USDT. 

## Verdict

The user can only send and receive USDT. However, it can trade Bitcoin via CFDs. It **cannot send and receive Bitcoins**.
