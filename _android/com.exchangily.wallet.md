This app is a self-custodial Bitcoin wallet:

> With eXchangily, you own and control your private key, ensuring your crypto
  assets are kept in your wallet, giving you absolute control and 100%
  autonomous ownership.

They are also open source:

> FAB and eXchangily are open source projects, unlike other exchanges we have
  nothing to hide, anyone can see our code at any time.

Notably their website does not link to this Play Store app!

But unfortunately there are no build instructions and
[Emanuel failed to build it](https://github.com/blockchaingate/exchangily-mobile-app/issues/1)
and I have no further ideas to make it build after all. This app is **not verifiable**.
