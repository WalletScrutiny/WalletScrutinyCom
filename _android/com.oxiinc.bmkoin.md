## Analysis 

- The website is still online, however, when we clicked on 'Register', it redirected us to another website, wealthmark.io. 
- We opened the app and it just displayed an error along with the splash logo [(Screenshot)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1663818201635999744): 

> com.android.volley.NoConnectionError:
>
> javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException:
>
> java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: Trust 
>
> anchor for certification path not found  

The same error arises in other environments.

- The BMKoin GitHub repository is empty.
- A little social media research brings us to this allegation on [twitter:](https://twitter.com/hkmaurya1986/status/1357733236122603521)

> कुत्ते की तरह भाग रही है कंपनी ग्राहकों का पैसा लेके
>
> Translated from Hindi by Google 
>
> The company is running like a dog after taking customers' money.

- The non-working app, the last update date (2020), plus the scam allegations lead us to conclude that this app is **defunct**. Since the website is still working, we'll email them at their listed email address: developeroxiinc@gmail.com to verify.
