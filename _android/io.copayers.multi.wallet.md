**Update 2022-01-21**: This app is not available anymore.

This product
"by [BitPay Crypto Inc](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=BitPay+Crypto+Inc)"
probably is a fake wallet.

"BitPay" is a well known name in the Bitcoin space, providing for example
{% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.bitpay.wallet' verdict='true' %}
which formerly was called Copay, with above logo.

Furthermore the listing contains no link to the provider's website and the
developer contact mail `service@copay.io` points to `copay.io` which redirects
to a warning about fake BitPay Wallets:

> WE HAVE DETECTED SOME FAKE COPAY WALLETS ON THE GOOGLE PLAY STORE FOR ANDROID
  THAT WILL STEAL YOUR COINS
> 
> PLEASE BE SURE TO ONLY INSTALL "BITPAY WALLET" ONLY FROM THE APP STORES
> 
> APP's DEVELOPER SHOULD BE "BITPAY INC"
