## Analysis 

- The app is primarily in Korean. 
- We granted several permissions and tried to register.
- One of the conditions we were asked to 'agree' to included this: 
  > I confirm that I am not a citizen, permanent resident, or resident of a country or region designated as an anti-money laundering priority by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) or I will not use the service while staying in the abovementioned countries.
- We ended up with an app page with some Korean text: 
  > *Identity verification failed*
  >
  > *This is not an open site. Please contact the administrator*
- We then go to the homepage for the app to find more information.
- The app's homepage features several metaverse items for a P2E(Play2Earn) game.
- The app just displays a [blank white screen](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1694567283874767199) in the "Secure Identity Verification" display. 
- On their website, a link with a wallet icon, leads to a Microsoft One drive link with the following error:
  > This item might not exist or is no longer available

We will mark this as **defunct** until the provider [replies.](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1694567283874767199)
