**Update 2022-04-10**: This app is not available anymore.

Cryptonator cryptocurrency wallet
makes no claim to be non-custodial but the
[Customer Support](https://www.cryptonator.com/contact/other/)
is pretty unambiguously pointing towards it being custodial:

> **Do you provide private keys?**: No

Absent source code this wallet is **not verifiable**.
