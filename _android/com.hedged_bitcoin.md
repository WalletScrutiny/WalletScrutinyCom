**Update 2022-02-26**: This app is not available anymore.

## App Description

> Hedged Bitcoin is a fully programmatic investment service designed to capture a large proportion of the long-term price appreciation of Bitcoin with reduced volatility. For investors looking to add cryptocurrencies to their portfolio, the question of when to enter is tricky. Hedged Bitcoin provides a conservative approach to crypto investing and makes any time the right time to begin.

### It is connected to the Uphold Wallet

> No investor accreditation is required, no minimum investment. Hedged Bitcoin is available globally as a web and mobile application powered by the Uphold Platform.

### It claims to allow withdrawals on the investments "at any time."

> Once your deposit on the waitlist is processed and invested, you can withdraw the funds at any time, without any lockups.

## The App

We were able to test out the app and found that it [connects to Uphold](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1463086346172448773).

The gist of which we quote:

> In order to facilitate the services provided by Hedged Bitcoin, you're authorizing Uphold to transfer your personal data and allowing the application to:
>
> 1. Accounts:
> - View all your Uphold Money Cards and their associated information.
> - Update existing Money Card names and create new Uphold Money Cards.
>
> 2. Transactions
> - Transfer funds from your Uphold wallet to the application.
>
> 3. User
> - View all the information associated to your Uphold wallet.

## Verdict

Since Hedged Bitcoin makes use of Uphold, which is a custodial service to manage investments and transactions, and since Uphold is a custodial service, this app is **custodial** and the app is **not-verifiable**.
