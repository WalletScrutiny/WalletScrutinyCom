**Update 2022-11-02**: The repository has not been updated in a long time and
the provider has not reacted to our enquiry to do so. This product is
**not verifiable**.

**Update 2022-04-07**: This product's provider appears to be partnering with
[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) and with their latest update they now
[encourage and help their users to migrate](https://brd.com/brd-joins-coinbase)
to [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet), a browser extension based
self-custodial wallet. The article is not (yet) talking about {{ page.title }}
being in sunset mode or obsolete but some consolidation appears to be going on.

**Update 2021-06-29**: The provider
[informed us](https://github.com/breadwallet/breadwallet-android/issues/117#issuecomment-869938323)
that the latest code can be found in a new repository. Apparently the
[new repository](https://github.com/breadwallet/brd-mobile)
is a fork of the
[old repository](https://github.com/breadwallet/breadwallet-android)
where they
[changed the license](https://github.com/breadwallet/brd-mobile/commit/9c563ce83521bebee375641a65e965392fa7057a)
from open source to some look-dont-touch license. For us, both provide the same
degree of transparency so we have to revert the last change in verdict. This app
does indeed share up to date source code although the git tag and the Play Store
version name [do differ](https://github.com/breadwallet/brd-mobile/issues/1).

**Update 2021-06-27**: As pointed out
[here](https://github.com/breadwallet/breadwallet-android/issues/117#issuecomment-869031603),
the provider stopped updating the public source repository and thus is to be
considered closed source. The current version on the Play Store is 4.10.0 from
yesterday. The latest version available on their GitHub is 4.9.1.1 from
2021-03-03.

This wallet claims not to be custodial and we found its supposed
[source code](https://github.com/breadwallet/breadwallet-android)
but we found no claim of verifiability and so verification was difficult.

**Update:** The team reacted quickly to our reach-out after our first analysis via
[this issue](https://github.com/breadwallet/breadwallet-android/issues/117) on
their GitHub.

Now we find a tag `build-3.14.3.3` and can try to compile that:

```
$ git tag | grep 3.14.3
build-3.14.3.3
$ git checkout build-3.14.3.3
...
HEAD is now at a332b4d5 Merge branch 'pablobu/DROID-1497' into 'release/3.14.3'
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ docker run -v $PWD:/mnt -it beevelop/cordova bash
root@e34a31867b99:/tmp# cd /mnt/
root@e34a31867b99:/mnt# yes | $ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin/sdkmanager "platforms;android-28"
root@e34a31867b99:/mnt# ./gradlew :app:assemble
root@e34a31867b99:/mnt# ls app/build/outputs/apk/brd/release/*.apk
brd-release-3.14.2.1.apk  output.json
```

Now that doesn't look promising, given we need version `3.14.3` and indeed the
diff is huge and goes across many code files.

The content of AboutActivity for example confirms its the wrong version. Many of the
differences look harmless like this:

```
diff -r fromBuild/smali/com/breadwallet/presenter/activities/settings/AboutActivity.smali fromPlayStore/smali/com/breadwallet/presenter/activities/settings/AboutActivity.smali
157c157
<     const-string v4, "3.14.2"
---
>     const-string v4, "3.14.3"
```

But with these diffs we can't give it a pass:

```
Binary files fromBuild/lib/arm64-v8a/libcore.so and fromPlayStore/lib/arm64-v8a/libcore.so differ
Binary files fromBuild/lib/armeabi-v7a/libcore.so and fromPlayStore/lib/armeabi-v7a/libcore.so differ
Binary files fromBuild/lib/x86/libcore.so and fromPlayStore/lib/x86/libcore.so differ
Binary files fromBuild/lib/x86_64/libcore.so and fromPlayStore/lib/x86_64/libcore.so differ
```

Diffoscope yields user directories in its 397662 lines of diff:

```

This looks like NDK being the culprit for part of the diff, apart from it being
the wrong version. Hopefully with Docker this can be improved.

Our verdict
-----------

We conclude that we hope for a quick resolution of the issues but for now
this wallet remains **not verifiable**.
