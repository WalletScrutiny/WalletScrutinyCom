## Analysis 

The site's homepage is no longer online and we could not register with the app. Based on the site's archived Terms and Conditions page, it has a termination policy: 

> Users are warned that CforCoins will in no way tolerate illegal activities on the site or application Users caught doing so will have their account terminated. CforCoins has all rights to terminate the user account but will reconsider its decision if a reasonable explanation is provided.

This custodial service is **no longer operational** as evidenced by the offline status of its website and its dormant social media accounts.
