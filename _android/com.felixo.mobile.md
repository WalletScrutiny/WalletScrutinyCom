## Analysis

- The app immediately presented us with a multicurrency tracker. 
- We found out that they used a mix of hot and cold-wallets in [Section 3.12 of their terms.](https://www.felixo.com/en/contracts/user-agreement). 90% of the user's funds are held in Cold Wallets. 
- This is evidence that the platform is *custodial*, and thus **not-verifiable**.
