## App Description from Google Play

> Turn your crypto into any one of 29 fiat currencies of your choice, including EUR, USD, GBP, AUD and SGD with the knowledge that your money will be transferred to you as soon as the transaction is completed.
>
> 3. Deposit your crypto
> - Into a wallet we generate for you 

## Analysis 

- [BTC deposits](https://www.crypto2cash.com/how-to-deposit-your-cryptocurrency/) are supported, but with the primary intention to sell for fiat.  
- In a [FAQ article](https://www.crypto2cash.com/can-i-withdraw-the-cryptocurrency-i-have-deposited/), the provider indicated that it is **not their intention to be a wallet service.** To be able to withdraw cryptocurrencies, the user must contact support.
- Users can also purchase cryptocurrencies, but this is considered an extra service that must be covered by another contract. 
- There is a BTC wallet, but the documentation indicates that features such as withdrawals require contacting support indicating a level of control the platform has over the funds. The same is true for the buying of cryptocurrencies. Thus, it can be said that this app **cannot send and receive Bitcoin**.
