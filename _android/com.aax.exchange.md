  Additionally, AAX has Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) in place to protect end-user private keys used to co-sign transactions.

Storage Security

> The majority of digital assets on AAX are held in secure offline storage facilities, leveraging industry-standard encryption technologies across multiple tiers. Sensitive data that normally resides on company servers is disconnected entirely from the Internet.<br>
  Upon request, AAX is also able to offer insured crypto custody within fully regulated entities.
