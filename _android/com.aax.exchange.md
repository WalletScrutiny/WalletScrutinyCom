> AAX has built a proprietary multi-currency wallet system. This system complies with industry standards, is multi-signature and offers no single point of failure. There is no dependency on a single source of security and robust recovery protocols are in place.<br>
  Additionally, AAX has Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) in place to protect end-user private keys used to co-sign transactions.

Storage Security

> The majority of digital assets on AAX are held in secure offline storage facilities, leveraging industry-standard encryption technologies across multiple tiers. Sensitive data that normally resides on company servers is disconnected entirely from the Internet.<br>
  Upon request, AAX is also able to offer insured crypto custody within fully regulated entities.

From [AAX Terms of Use](https://www.aax.com/en-US/legal-privacy/terms-of-use/):
