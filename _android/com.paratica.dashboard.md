> Paratica is fully customisable auto trading system for cryptocurrencies, for Binance Exchange. It runs on cloud. Once you set up your bot, Paratica runs it for you even while you are asleep.

You can make authorization edits in this link. Your Paratica bot will not be authorized to withdraw your assets.

## Analysis 

Apart from paratica.com, {{ page.title }} is connected with Traderlands.com. 

Traderlands.com is described as a "social algorithmic trading" platform. 

We tried to get the app running, but it only showed a blank screen. 

From this video, we can glean how {{ page.title }} works: 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bK8RBdm95Aw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The app does not have a BTC wallet.
