## App Description

>  Buy, sell, and exchange Bitcoin and the most popular altcoins and stablecoins

## The App

The app only requires ID verification if you are converting from or to fiat currency. It is similar to:

{% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.changelly.app' verdict='true' %}

The user has to input a receiving address and send coins to xchangebg's own address for conversions or swaps to happen. No funds are stored on the app.

## Verdict

This exchange is **not a wallet**.
