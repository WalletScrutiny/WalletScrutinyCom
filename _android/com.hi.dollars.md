  When I first started using the application it got my interest because the app provides some rewards. You had to login and collect your reward once per day. The platform requested the user to wait patiently for one year to unlock that rewards, then you could either sell or stake it. I want to say that alot has been changed from what the platform initially promised.

  What rubbish... You now make it compulsory to invite a friend every 7days before one can earn HI???? Where is the ease in saying HI??? It's easier when earning on WhatsApp!!! Even KYC is so hard to get done. I have tired 4x still to no avail. I better off just uninstall this app. Is either the earning stops than placing a stupid criteria on it!!! YOU JUST LOST A LOYAL USER!!!!
