- A Bech32 BTC address is available for receiving or sending.
- There were no claims regarding source-availability.
- A 'code search' on GitHub for the app ID, yielded [0 results.](https://github.com/search?q=network.privapp.wallet&type=code). The organization's [GitHub account](https://github.com/PrivappNetwork) is linked from the website, however it only has 2 repositories that do not identify as the Android app.
- This app is **not source-available.**
