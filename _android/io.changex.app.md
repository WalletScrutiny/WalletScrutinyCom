## Analysis

- Initializing the app starts with creating a new wallet or importing an existing one.
- Creating a new wallet has two options:
  - Simple Wallet
  - Custom Cypher Wallet
- We opted for a simple wallet.
- The app generated the private keys.
The main app interface appeared with a notice on top, to 'backup your wallet'
- The 12-word mnemonics was provided.
- We then accessed a Bech32 BTC address with send and receive functions.
- We searched on GitHub Code for the app ID, and [found 5](https://github.com/search?q=io.changex.app&type=code) repositories. All of them are related to the ChangeX website and not to the actual app.
- The providers did not claim to be source-available. This app is **not source-available**.
