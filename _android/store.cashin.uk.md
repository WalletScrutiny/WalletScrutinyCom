These are the [ways to withdraw Bitcoin](https://www.bitcoinpoint.com/20-key-points-in-plain-english/) from the BitcoinPoint wallet:

1. Bank
2. ATM
3. Another Bitcoin wallet or BitcoinPoint user

## Third-Party Media Mentions

Decrypt Media [reports](https://twitter.com/decryptmedia/status/1342100310819561473) on BitcoinPoint about their partnership with ATM operator Cash Zone. This would allow bitcoin holders to cash out via its network of ATMs.

## The App

The first screen informed us to "scan a wallet to directly transact with it. It then asked us to provide a mobile phone number. The OTP SMS verification did not arrive. 

Legal information and specifics could be found in this document ([PDF](https://www.bitcoinpoint.com/legal/)).

## Cold Storage

> All of our Online Wallets are on Cold Storage which means that their private keys are not on the internet.

## Verdict

The wallets are purportedly kept offline in cold storage and there is no evidence of private keys being provided to the user. In this case, it appears as though BitcoinPoint is a **custodial** service. This makes the app **not verifiable**.
