## Analysis 

- The app is geo-restricted to Brazilian entities
- A CPF is required 
- Section 2.8 of the [Terms](https://bipa.app/termos-de-uso.pdf) - right to refuse registration to users 
   - Section 2.10 - power to delete user account. 
   - Section 3.1 - opening a user account means opening an account with their partner, Bankly. 
   - Section 5.1.2 - withdrawal of crypto-assets
- We were not able to register, but with the facts from the description and terms, we establish: 
1. The app should have a Bitcoin wallet that can send/receive 
2. There was no mention of private keys
3. This is an app that complies with the regulations of the Central Bank of Brazil, with anti-terrorism, KYC, anti money laundering laws and has the power to bar the user from accessing the account for grounds stated in the terms. 

Therefore, we conclude that this is a **custodial** provider.
