> The Swissquote Trading app puts the worldâ€™s financial markets at your fingertips, allowing you to invest in a wide range of products, from stocks and ETFs to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

## Relation to other apps

  - {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.yuh' verdict='true' %}
  - {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.swissquote.mobiletrader.android.wl.acm' verdict='true' %}
- The Yuh app [describes](https://www.yuh.com/en/help/faq/invest/#9e41768cb22709ab6e26dfe8dd2c6c9c) Swissquote as their "founding mother and custodian bank". 
- Securities cannot be transferred from Swissquote to Yuh, but existing users of Swissquote will find an easier onboarding process to Yuh.
- Both Swissquote and Yuh link to each other on their respective websites. 
- The Yuh app is geared towards a younger demographic and also serves as a [reward platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jldy5qugfU8) where users are given [Swissqoin](https://www.yuh.com/en/help/faq/invest/#9e41768cb22709ab6e26dfe8dd2c6c9c), which is an [ERC20 token](https://etherscan.io/token/0x2521e19666f4e678ff5af3593c38d3dabd72d4da).

## Analysis 

- A [press release](https://en.swissquote.com/sites/default/files/2023-03/pressrelease_results_fy-2022.pdf) details that the platform uses more than *cold-storage* but *multiple custodian models in asset storage*. 
- This is a **custodial** service.
