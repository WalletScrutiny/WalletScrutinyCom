## Analysis 

### HashKey Me [Announces Rebranding](https://www.hashkey.com/en/newsroom/web3-did-wallet-hashkey-me-announces-rebranding)

- The app cannot be installed in Android Emulator API 27 and 29
- It also cannot be installed on our mobile device
- It also cannot be installed in BlueStacks 5 Android 7
- 
- The archived version of the subdomain in 2022, describes the app's security as: 

> Secure private key fragments backup based on threshold signature scheme.

- We were finally able to install it on BlueStacks 5 Android 9 - but the app kept closing.
- With no successful way to test the app, we are left with the description found on its site: 

> HashKey Me is a decentralised identity wallet supporting multiple blockchains. **HashKey Me safeguards your assets by simple complete user registration and authentication with no private key or Mnemonic phase needed to be memorised...**

- With no private key provided to the user, this app is **custodial**.
