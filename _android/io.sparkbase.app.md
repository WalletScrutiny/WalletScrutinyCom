## Analysis

- We were not able to register since the app and the web platform, did not allow it. There was no error message. Once we filled up the fields in the registration form, it reset, so we have to fill it up again.
- There is nothing to indicate that this is a bitcoin wallet. The wording on its description and website describes staking a [Sparkbase token & Masternodes](https://www.sparkbase.io/sparkbase-token). The token wallet has a separate download. This is **not a wallet**.
