Note: The app name is similar to 

- {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.bitpay.wallet' verdict='true' %}

The only difference is this app has a '7' between the word 'bit' and 'pay'. 

The homepage for this app is no longer online.

## Analysis 

We were able to acquire a copy of this app's APK, and install it on our virtual device. The splash screen and login screen was displayed. When we clicked Sign Up, we were greeted with a blank screen. 

We surmise this is because of the offline status of its website. 

It is highly probable this app is already **defunct**.
