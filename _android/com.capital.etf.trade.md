  ★★☆☆☆ March 4, 2022 <br>
       Customer Service is of no real help. They clearly just go by a sheet they're following. Absolutely no real help to solve any problem I've had. App is nice looking but that's as far as it goes. They recently robbed me on a trade and got no real support as to why. Will be investigating it.

       It was nice. But from last December it not processing my withdrawal. Every time they simply declined my request. When ever raising a query, they mail mail back help on the way.

       NEVER use this platform! They will automatically sell your stocks shares at a HUGE loss , its indicated in the small terms and condition which nobody can read! Beware! I was trading OIL to shoot up when it was 28-30usd in 2020 per barrel.. they automatically sold all my shares while you are asleep.. its a FRAUD!!

## Analysis

- It has a different developer [Capital Com UK Limited](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Capital+Com+UK+Limited). The original app is linked to from capital.com, with the developer as [Capital Com SV Investments Limited](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=5723292543470816278). This one isn't.
- We checked the backlinks and found that most of the backlinks for this app came from third-party apk sites.
- The app appears to present itself as an "ETF version" from "Capital.com UK". With no links to such, these claims are dubious.
- The app's general appearance seems to mimic the original's, save for one factor: ID verification on the original app is more stringent.
- We tried to verify with the capital.com listed [twitter account](https://twitter.com/dannybuntu/status/1755503677354475981), but have yet to receive a reply.
- Out of the abundance of caution, we will mark this as a **fake** app until we receive a reply.
