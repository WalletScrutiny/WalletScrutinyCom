## App Description

The app description on Google Play was pretty sparse with only a reference to the expertise of their developers. There was also mention of staking.

## The Site

On its [homepage](https://figcoin.online), FIG is described as the "WORLD FASTEST DECENTRALIZED GAME ASSET PLATFORM ON BLOCKCHAIN."

## The App

There [doesn't seem to be any BTC support](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1458342323188686848) for this app.

## Verdict

This is **not a bitcoin wallet**.
