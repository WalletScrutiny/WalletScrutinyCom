The app has its own token, the AABB Gold Token which they say is "backed by $30 million in physical gold owned by Asia Broadband, Inc."

## The App

Upon installation of the app, we are asked to create or import a wallet. The backup phrase is only 6 words which means this app is at best not compatible with [BIP 39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki) compatible wallets and at worst can be easily hacked. There is BTC support as well as other coins and tokens.

A referral option is available.

Users can fill out AML/KYC forms to get increased transaction limits.

## Verdict

We are led to believe that this wallet is a **self-custodial wallet**. However, the presence of "ICOs" should give the user some circumspection about the app. Additionally, the name Asia Broadband Inc., seems a bit generic for a blockchain oriented company. The lure of a token that is "reportedly" backed by gold, also gives one pause. 

We were **not able to locate the source code** for this project.
