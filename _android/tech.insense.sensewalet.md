**Update 2022-01-04**: As of today, the homepage for this app is now up for sale. [(Twitter Screenshot)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1478318114106318850)

Note, however that their iOS app has been updated last 2021-09-09


**Update 2021-11-07**: This app is not available anymore.

In their description we read:

> *You, as owner of wallet, fully control the private key:*
  * "iWallet"does not store info about users, data about private keys, or funds
    on servers.
  * Private keys are stored on your device.

so they are non-custodial.

The following is their website in its entirety:

So, trusting their claim from the Play Store, not finding any further data to
verify it, we remain with the verdict: **not verifiable**.
