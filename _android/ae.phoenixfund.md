## App Description 

> Established by a group of investors and crypto mining experts, The Phoenix Fund is a secure space for investors with favorable rates on mining machines, preferred electricity rates, a crypto-friendly ecosystem and investment.

## Analysis 

- The website leads to a web design company 
- We tried to register with the app, but it simply gave a message that the provider will get back to us soon. 
- The app description doesn't offer enough description to ascertain whether it supports a Bitcoin wallet. 
- We emailed them at the listed email address info@plana.ae
- We'll keep this as a work-in-progress for the meantime.
