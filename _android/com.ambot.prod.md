## App Description from Google Play

> AM BOT is a cryptocurrency trading bot with an automated software tool that helps you trade cryptocurrencies. Making a trade at just the right time requires a person or a team to monitor the market attentively and constantly. A couple of seconds can make the difference between profit and a loss. But 24/7 physical monitoring is just impossible and costly. So, the AM Bot is THE solution.

## Analysis 

- Normally cryptocurrency trading bots have no wallets since they connect to various cryptocurrency exchanges using APIs. 
- However, this one hosts a USDT wallet which can send and receive.
- Thus, our verdict is that this app **doesn't support a bitcoin wallet**.
