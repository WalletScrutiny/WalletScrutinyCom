## App Description from Google Play

> Secure, customizable non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet
>
> Keep your bitcoin and other digital currency secure and under your own control with the non-custodial Coin Cloud Wallet app. No third-party custodial services or key management â€” we put the power back in your hands with full access to your locally stored private keys, so what you do with your money is always your choice.

## Analysis

- We were not able to install since the app was geo-restricted.
- The domain coin.cloud redirects to bitstop.co
- Coin.cloud used to have articles about storing the mnemonics, but these are no longer accessible after they started redirecting their domain to bitstop. This is still accessible via [archive.org.](https://web.archive.org/web/20230329040518/https://www.coin.cloud/blog/how-to-secure-your-coin-cloud-wallet)
- BitStop is a Bitcoin ATM service provider. They require KYC, and according to their terms, may require users to submit information such as Tax Identification, proof of ownership of the email address, etc.
- They claim to be non-custodial. We were [not able to find](https://github.com/search?q=com.coincloud.walletpreview&type=code) any instances of their app ID, when searching GitHub Code. They did **not claim to be source-available.**
