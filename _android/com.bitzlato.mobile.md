## App Description from Google Play

> Securely store cryptocurrency in your wallet on Bitzlato, buy and sell cryptocurrencies through more than a hundred payment methods available on Bitzlato.

## Analysis

- The app is geo-restricted so we were not able to install.
- This was related to the Hydra Darknet market.
- On the website listed under its developer contact, a notice of [judicial seizure](https://twitter.com/dannybuntu/status/1681999044942639105) was posted. This makes the app likely to be **defunct.**
