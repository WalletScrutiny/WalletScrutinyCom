## App Description from Google Play 

> EyeWallet is a virtual wallet with a virtual database that can send, receive and change your cryptocurrencies safely

## Analysis 

- The listed website is no longer available.
- The last working archive for the website was made in 2019 
- The app was last updated in 2020
- When we tried to register, it gave an error:

> We are sorry!
>
> At this time we cannot establish a connection to the server, try again later. If the problem persists please contact support. 

Without the website, and with a non-working app that's been updated 3 years ago, this app is **defunct**.
