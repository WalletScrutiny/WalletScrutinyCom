## Analysis 

This is a copy of the hardware wallet review which was quite extensive: 

They have a token sale [$OCW](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/online-cold-wallet/)

### More details

[Whitepaper](https://www.onlinecoldwallet.com/assets/docs/WHITEPAPER.pdf)

In the Whitepaper, under 'Main Features' it describes its "Hardware Cold Wallet"

> The computers with private keys connected to the internet or the wallets on smartphones will make usersâ€™ funds
vulnerable to numerous attack types. A hardware
wallet is like an unbreakable safe with a small gap. Even
if someone accesses your hardware wallet, the PIN
code will provide you with additional safety.

We were not able to find a technical specification sheet.

Its GitHub page only shows one repository titled "Docs". This merely features their Gitbook entries for common procedures such as how to withdraw, [how to create a wallet](https://github.com/ocwallet/docs/blob/main/computer-information/create-a-wallet.md), etc.

## Analysis 

We tried to register to the service provided by the app and through the website. 

We received the [same error](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1630398696402845696) on both platforms:

> "You cannot register due to maintenance work. Please try again later."

From their Gitbook entry on ["How to create a wallet"](https://github.com/ocwallet/docs/blob/main/computer-information/create-a-wallet.md) 

> After logging in to your account with your user information, go to the wallet.
>
> Then go to the wallet creation page for the address you will withdraw by clicking on add wallet.
>
> Wallet Name: This is the field that acts as a reminder if you are going to add more than one withdrawal address, for example, my X Wallet.
>
> Wallet Address: Your private wallet address where you will withdraw crypto.

We were not able to find documentation on how the card or a the app handles the private keys. 

Since we were also not able to register due to the error, we were not able to find backup options. 

We reached out to [@ocwallet](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1630412053780508672) on twitter to ask these questions. 

We were also not able to find the option to buy the card, but instead we found, "Buy Tokens". 

## Verdict 

For now, we are not able to find a conclusion for the product. We will await further information from the provider.
