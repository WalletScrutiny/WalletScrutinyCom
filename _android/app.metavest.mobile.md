## App Description from Google Play

  > Metavest integrates existing DeFi platforms and blockchains into a user-friendly interface to offer the best opportunities in the crypto market. Metavest at its core is positioned as an investment opportunity aggregator; its agile features, speed, and user experience shine out above other players in the market.
  >
  > We are pleased to announce the utility token of Metavest App, MVST which has been meticulously designed for its holders, including exclusive APR offers on fixed-income investment products and free crypto withdrawals per month as well as creating a detailed tier system
  >
  > Supports BTC.

## Analysis 

- After the email was verified, we tried accessing the bitcoin wallet. However, this message appeared:
  > KYC level 1 verification required. Please complete verification to access your wallet.
- We found their security page, where it was [mentioned](https://metavest.app/security) that:
  > The provider works with Fireblocks with a custodial solution.
- This explicitly proves that the provider is **custodial** and the app is **non-verifiable**.
