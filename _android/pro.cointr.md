## Analysis

- We signed up but the email verification did not contain the code to input in the form. It merely told us to "login directly". We closed the app and opened it again and logged in using the details we provided. This time, they sent a code.
- There are two tabs at the top of the app:
  - Exchange
  - Wallet

### Wallet Section

- The wallet section allows us to create a wallet, but the "import wallet" option says "Coming soon"
- We set a wallet password.
- It sent another verification email. It consisted of 6 digits.
- It then asked us to back up the wallet password which is in ciphertext, which has 64 chracters.
- We tapped on "Complete", and it gave a message that the Web3 Wallet was created.
- A multichain wallet was presented with various tokens. The primary network is ETH. The secondary network was TRON.
- There is no bitcoin.
- The seed phrase and the private keys have their own export functions.

### Exchange

- This is a centralized cryptocurrency exchange located within the same app.
- It is possible to deposit with a Bech32 BTC address.
- This [Help Document](https://support.cointr.pro/hc/en-us/articles/5211778969103-How-to-withdraw-Web-) describes how users can withdraw BTC from the platform.

## [Terms](https://support.cointr.pro/hc/en-us/articles/5224297265423)

- Section 3 gives the platform the power to freeze the user's funds
- Section 3.1 describes the process by which trade orders are made on the platform. This clause also describes how the platform has control over user funds.
- Section 6.1 gives the platform the power to terminate the user's access at any time without prior notice to the user.

Despite the ability to export the seed phrases and the private keys in the Crypto Web3 wallet located within the same app, we believe this is a custodial provider for the simple fact that users would still have to login before they can either import a wallet or create a wallet.

If there is no login access, there is no access to the web 3 wallet. This is a **custodial** app.
