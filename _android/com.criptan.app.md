## Analysis 

> Criptan uses robust and proven technology over the years for the **custody of its customersâ€™ crypto assets**. Most of the funds (+80%) are stored in ultra-cold multi-signature wallets that require the collaboration of several different employees, located in geographically dispersed locations, to move the funds. **The remaining funds, stored in cold, warm, and hot wallets**, as well as with the liquidity providers Criptan works with, also require the collaboration of different individuals within the Criptan team. No cryptocurrency can be transferred by any individual person. The **recovery keys for these wallets are kept in physical security vaults**.

This is a **custodial** service with a non-verifiable app.
