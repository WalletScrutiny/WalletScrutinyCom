## Analysis

- The app provided the 12-word mnemonic phrase
- We could not find the BTC wallet. There was an option to add a network/custom RPC but the defaults are:
  - Ethereum
  - BNB Smart Chain
  - Polygon (Matic)
  - Optimistic Ethereum
  - Arbitrum One
  - Solana
- This app **does not support BTC** on the BTC network by default.
