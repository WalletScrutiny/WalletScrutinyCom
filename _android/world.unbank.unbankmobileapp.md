## Analysis 

- App use is limited by region. We were not able to install this app.
- According to the FAQs, a valid US-Government ID is required to sign up to the service. 
- Based on the description we can intuit how it works:

> ### Sell Cryptocurrency 
>
> Sell cryptocurrency through the app for Cash Pickup at over 20,000 ATM kiosks
> 1. Find Location
> 2. Input Desired Amount
> 3. Send Crypto to Pay Invoice
> 4. Redeem Cash at the selected Location

> ### Buy Crypto Currency
>
> 1. Find Locations
> 2. Add Cash Now
> 3. **Input Wallet Address**
> 4. Provide Cash to cashier at selected Location
> 5. Crypto Currency is Sent to your address

The description of the process in buying and selling Bitcoin tells us that this is indeed a non-custodial app that **does not provide a wallet** to the user. When buying bitcoin for instance, the user must input the wallet address where the coins will be sent.
