       Tried to test withdrawal, asks for an email address and then a box with ERR and that's it.

We tried the game, and similar to Steven Lees-Smith's feedback, we got the ERR. [Screenshot](https://x.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1831248708887056520)

## Analysis 

This app is a game, and **does not provide any wallet**. It references a certain third-party service called FaucetPay which has the same likeness as the logo found here: https://faucetpay.io. But it is not functional as a wallet.

When we clicked its "Website" link in the Google Play page, we were redirected to its [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/BProgrammers).
