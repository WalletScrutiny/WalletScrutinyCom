## Analysis

- After registration, we were given the option to deposit. We chose BTC and were given a P2SH address generated by the app. We did not see any option to backup the private keys.
- The main interface shows the following options:
  - SELECTED
  - Copy Trading
  - Trading Bot
  - Agent Recruitment
  - Referral Rebate
  - Financing
  - Quickbuy
  - Deposit
  - Reward Center
- The bottom panel's options:
  - Home
  - Markets
  - Trade
  - Futures
  - Assets
- According to the [Terms](https://bibox.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900001318446), citizens of US, China and Japan are prohibited from using the platform.
- The termination clause is located in Reminder No. 5.
- The service can terminate the user's account at any time.
- The service exercises "Transaction Supervision" found in [Section 4](https://bibox.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900001318446). This allows the provider to judge whether certain transactions are "suspicious", the power to cancel these and finally, to report these to the authorities.
- We cannot find any option to backup the private keys. Although there is no mention of cold-storage apart from some general informational articles, most funds are stored on what it calls, "[MyWallet](https://bibox.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900000726506--My-Wallet-and-Asset-Transfer)". Most transactions are carried out in MyWallet, including lending.
- It is not explicitly mentioned whether the platform uses cold-storage but has all the appearances of a **custodial** exchange. The strongest evidence proving this is the lack of private key backup option.
