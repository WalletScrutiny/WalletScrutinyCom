## Analysis 

- The listed website connected with this app is issuing a "Connection Timed Out Error"
- When we installed the app, it showed the splash screen then this error: [(Screenshots)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1656570054694301697)

> No Internet Connection
>
> Something went wrong in server 

- We tried to email them via the listed email address at info@btc-bank.app, but this was quickly returned because of an "Address not found" error. 
- We have reason to believe that this app is now defunct, but has recently been updated in 2022, so we'll wait a bit more and retain it as a **work-in-progress**.
