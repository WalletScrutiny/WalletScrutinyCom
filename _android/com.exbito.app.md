## App Description from Google Play 

> Exbito Wallet enables users to securely hold all types of cryptocurrencies. As a maximum security wallet, it is backed by the vast experience of its developer team. Safe Exbito Wallets are available in various networks offering a variety of security features.

## Analysis 

- With some difficulty we managed to register via the web app. 
- We saw a BTC wallet, but before the address was shown, we were required to perform ID verification. There is documentation to support the ability to deposit Bitcoin. This is supported by the [FAQ](https://exbito.com/help/faq/).
- This is a centralized cryptocurrency exchange and clause 3 of the [terms](https://exbito.com/terms-and-conditions/), slightly indicates that assets are secured by the provider. 
- We were not able to find any option to back up the private keys nor were we given the mnemonics during sign up. 
- Although there is no explicit mention of using cold-storage or how the platform treats the private keys, all indications point to a **custodial** provider.
