## App Description from Google Play 

> Digital Currency Exchange Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Exchange acts as an intermediary between cryptocurrency exchanges and customers, providing you with the best bitcoin exchange rates.
>
> We do not charge any hidden or unreasonable fees - just a 0.25% exchange commission and network fees required to send transactions on the blockchain.

## Analysis 

- The app does not have a listed website. 
- Generally speaking, this app is described as a "Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Exchange". However when opened, it displays in bold faced letters, "TRX TRON", and **then promptly closes**. This first instance was tested on Android Studio API 27. 
- We replicated the same behavior on BlueStacks 5 Android Pie.
- We emailed themeqswz@gmail.com, the developer to find out more. 
- At the interim, this sounds like an exchange, but without any more to go by, we'll keep this as a **work-in-progress**.
