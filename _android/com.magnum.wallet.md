In the app's description we read:

> **Simple & Secure Interface**
> Stay on top of your portfolio with intuitive navigation anytime, anywhere.
> With security & anonymity as our top priorities, we provide a fully
> non-custodial service, meaning that users have full control of their private
> keys and other personal information.

So this wallet claims to be non-custodial but can we find its source code?
Neither on Google Play nor on their website do we find a word about this product's
source code. Its properties thus are **not verifiable**.
