## Analysis

- The website listed in the Google Play description is offline.
- We installed the app and created a wallet with a 12-word seed phrase.
- This can be backed up from the settings.
- However, we could not find a BTC wallet. Which is strange, since the description states that this is supported.

**Bitcoin is not supported** in this app plus, the absence of the website is an indicator that it may already be **defunct**.
