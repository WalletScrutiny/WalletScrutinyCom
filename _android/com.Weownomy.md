## Analysis 

- Its developer contact in Google Play lists office@weownomy.global as its email contact. The domain hosts a blog which advertises hypertension medicine such as Norvasc.
- We installed the app and were given the choice to create a wallet or import. We chose create a wallet, but got an error:

     > Alert
     > getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND prod-weownomy.ctcf8okglxh7.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com

- The app is not working anymore, so the verdict we can give is **defunct**.
