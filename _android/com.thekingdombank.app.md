       Impossible to use, can't even login. Stuck in a loop... Attempt to login "must verify email", so I verify my email, which returns me to the login screen, which repeats "must verify email"... Supreme Incompetence!!!

## Analysis 

- This bank allows users to accept [crypto payments](https://www.thekingdombank.com/crypto-payments). 
- They also described themselves as a full-service bank and that all funds are kept "in the bank". We just need to substantiate what they mean by this.
- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXpe4KezeAY) - How to deposit cryptocurrencies.
- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJ5S4u9J31o) - Making crypto-payments
- We were able to find a Bitcoin wallet with a Bech32 BTC address. 
- Curiously, the notice at the bottom states that we have to make sure that we are using the Binance Smart Chain.
- We were not provided the mnemonic phrases during start-up.
- There was no option to back up the private keys in the options. 
- These facts, implicitly tell us that this is a **custodial** account even though the words *cold-storage* or *custodial* were not found in the site. This makes the app, **non-verifiable**.
