**Update:** This app is not on Google Play anymore

Bcoiner - Free Bitcoin Wallet
does not share clear information it looks custodial and absent source code it is
definitely **not verifiable**.

Other observations
------------------

* The ratings are ... suspicious. Blocks of 5 star and 1 star claiming 5 star
  are fake and scam accusations.
