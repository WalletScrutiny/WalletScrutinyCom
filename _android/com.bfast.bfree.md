## Analysis 

We signed up using Google. The app displays video ads the moment after signing up. It then displays the "game" which consists of buttons with random numbers. We ticked one of the options to look for a wallet and it asked us to complete a survey. 

Tapping the burger menu, showed an advertisement for gomining app. They claim to allow users to mine without the mining equipment. Every tap on the device, will show a video advertisement.

This app has **no wallet**. It's merely an app that advertises a lot of low quality and suspicious apps.
