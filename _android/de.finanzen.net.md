Translated from the app's description:

> Stocks, share prices, cryptocurrencies, real-time stock market prices, ETF savings plan and everything about the DAX - the stock market app from finanzen.net offers this and more.

This app is meant to function as a trading platform. Some of its features include a free custody account, real time price alerts and financial news.

> CRYPTOCURRENCIES
- Now buy and sell cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin directly in the app
- No wallet, no paperwork
- Made in Germany

As this is a trading platform, and as there is no indication otherwise, it is most likely custodial and **does not allow users to send or receive crypto assets.**
