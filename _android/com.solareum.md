**Note:** There is an ICO with a similar name.

## App Description from the [website]()

> Solareum will help you store, send and receive all SPL tokens. Moreover, it is built on Solana blockchain so the transaction fee is really cheap

## Analysis 

This is primarily a Solana wallet with support for Wrapped Bitcoin -Sollet (SoBTC)

⚠️ A warning entry on CoinGecko describes Sollet:

> soBTC tokens are wrapped BTC tokens issued by FTX or Alameda. Both these entities have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and the BTC tokens are no longer redeemable.

This app **does not support Bitcoin**.
