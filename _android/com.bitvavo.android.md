> Buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies within minutes and store them in your integrated Bitvavo wallet.

The description says that it's a Digital Asset & Cryptocurrency Exchange. This marks it as possibly custodial.

You can deposit and withdraw, but QR codes aren't provided.

> [Before you can withdraw digital currencies](https://support.bitvavo.com/l/en/article/vp1kqa4i31-send-to-external-wallet) to an external address, you first need to add it to your address book, and get it verified.

Bitvavo requires verification before you can withdraw to external addresses.

> [As Bitvavo offers hosted wallets](https://support.bitvavo.com/l/en/article/3csr6klkfp-private-keys-hosted-wallet), it is unfortunately not possible to provide the private keys of individual wallets. 

This confirms it as **custodial** and thus **not verifiable.**
