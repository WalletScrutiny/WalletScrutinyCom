## Analysis 

- This seems to be an e-commerce app which provides the user with their own page. Sellers then can include a payment medium such as Bitcoin or Paypal. We located this feature and had to input a random bitcoin address.
- After signing up, one of the first things to do is to set up a store and choose the payment processor. 

The app does **not provide a standalone wallet** but asks users to provide their own addresses.
