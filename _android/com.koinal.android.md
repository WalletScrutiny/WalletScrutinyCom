This is their statement on security but it reads more like they are talking
about their servers than their wallet here. That would imply a custodial wallet.

A Bitcoin wallet should not care about borders, especially not if it's
non-custodial but maybe the user meant some buying option?

As there are no further claims on the website neither, we assume the app is
custodial and thus **not verifiable**.
