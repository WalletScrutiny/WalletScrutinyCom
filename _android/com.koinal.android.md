This is their statement on security but it reads more like they are talking
about their servers than their wallet here. That would imply a custodial wallet.

  Stay away, collects all your information THEN tells you it does not accept
  your country. SCAM!

A Bitcoin wallet should not care about borders, especially not if it's
non-custodial but maybe the user meant some buying option?

As there are no further claims on the website neither, we assume the app is
custodial and thus **not verifiable**.

**EDIT:**

We contacted the support and found out this information:

> Koinal does not provide wallets and related services. Therefore, our customers are required to use their external wallets for their crypto purchases.

So there's **no BTC wallet services.**
