Apart from {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.bitgo.mobile' verdict='true' %}, and according to Coinext's terms:

> COINEXT uses international cryptoasset brokers (exchanges) as a way to meet the demand for cryptoassets in Brazil. In this sense, COINEXT maintains a relevant position of cash in US dollars and cryptocurrencies in these institutions to operationalize acquisitions of crypto assets on behalf of its Users. The institutions with which Coinext currently holds such positions are Payward Inc., Weave Markets LTD., Weave Markets LLC., Bitstamp Limited, Bitfinex Inc., tiFinex Inc., OSL SG PTE. LTD.

Wallets are hosted on accounts on the platform which means that control over private keys belongs to the provider and is therefore a **custodial** service.
