On Google Play we read (emphasize ours):

> Security and Stability: BitMart adopts an advanced multi-layer and
  multi-cluster system architecture to ensure the security, stability, and
  scalability of the system. Its blockchain nodes apply **hot/cold wallet**
  technology while the operating modes of secret keys and addresses are
  optimized according to the features of blockchain to ensure the security of
  users' assets.

A "hot" wallet is online, a "cold" wallet is offline. Your phone is certainly
not "cold", so it's them who hold the keys. As a custodial service the app is
**not verifiable**.
