On their website we read:

> **Secure**<br>
  Advanced risk control system in the market. Hybrid hot/cold wallet systems and
  multi-signature technologies. 100% secure for trading and digital asset
  management

A "hot" wallet is online, a "cold" wallet is offline. Your phone is certainly
not "cold", so it's them who hold the keys. As a custodial service the app is
**not verifiable**.
