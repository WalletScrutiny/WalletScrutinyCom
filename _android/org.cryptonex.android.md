## Analysis 

According to the [Terms of Use:](https://cryptonex.org/help/terms)

> CRYPTONEX shall accept, store, record, carry out Cryptocurrencies from the Users, make operations with it on behalf of the User and introduce Cryptocurrency to the User according at his request.

When we installed the app, 

- It issued an [error](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1654653331929972737) after the splash screen: "Unexpected Character"
- We tried the web app instead and found multiple coins. It also had deposit and withdrawal options for BTC. 
- We did not find private keys. 

As the terms elucidated, this is a **custodial app**.
