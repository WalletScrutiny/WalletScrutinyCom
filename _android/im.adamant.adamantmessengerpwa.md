## Analysis 

The app has multiple features integrated in 1 app. It has messenger, wallet, a GPT powered chat and an exchange among other things. 

We took a look at its repository and found 21 of these component parts - however, the Android repository has notably been archived since 2021. 

This goes to say that while it may have been publicly available for a time, the Android app's **source code hasn't been for a long time**. What's noteworthy about this is that their Google Play app has recently been updated on March 2023.
