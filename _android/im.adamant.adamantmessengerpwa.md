## Update 2024-07-20

We found the repository for Adamant IM Messenger with a [GitHub release version](https://github.com/Adamant-im/adamant-im/releases/tag/v4.7.3) that is close to the Google Play version. This app is scheduled **for verification**

## App Description from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.adamant.adamantmessengerpwa) 2023-04-15

> CRYPTO WALLET. Just a single password for all the internal cryptocurrencies: ADAMANT, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Doge, Dash, Binance coin, Bit-Z token, KuCoin token, Resfinex token, Stably Dollar. You have full control over private keys.

## Analysis 

The app has multiple features integrated in 1 app. It has messenger, wallet, a GPT powered chat and an exchange among other things. 

We took a look at its repository and found 21 of these component parts - however, the Android repository has notably been archived since 2021. 

This goes to say that while it may have been publicly available for a time, the Android app's **source code hasn't been for a long time**. What's noteworthy about this is that their Google Play app has recently been updated on March 2023.
