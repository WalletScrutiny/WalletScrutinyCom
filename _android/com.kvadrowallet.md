## App Description

Translated from Russian:

> KvadroWallet is a cryptocurrency wallet with an intuitive interface and easy-to-use functionality:
>
> - Cryptocurrency storage
> - Transfer / Withdrawal of cryptocurrency
> - and other useful tools

However, we see multiple evidences that point to this app not working.

- There is no site provided in the Play Store page. The email address domain for users to contact is gmail.com. Clicking the link to the Privacy Policy doesn't return a functioning website.
- The app is not functioning either, and only shows a white screen. There are only two reviews, and both complain about this.

We have come to the conclusion that, at the time of this review, this app is **not functioning.**
