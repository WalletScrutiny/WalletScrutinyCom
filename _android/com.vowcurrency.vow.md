## Update 2024-07-24

The app's source code remains not available, with no signs of accessibility.

## App Description from Google Play 2023-07-11

> Vow is a decentralised wallet application which allows you to securely store, send, swap and spend your Vow and Vow currencies. As the official wallet app of the Vow community, it offers full DEX support and the knowledge that all crypto assets are held with your own keys. The wallet supports BTC, ETH, VOW and all Vow currencies.

## Analysis

- We initialized the app and the first options were: 'Create new wallet', 'Restore existing wallet' and 'clear cache'.
- Choosing 'Create new wallet' opens an email and password form. We filled it and then the 12 word mnemonic phrase was provided. We verified.
- We were then asked to provide a 4-digit pin.
- The main interface was displayed allowing us to choose a wallet. A legacy BTC address is present with send and receive functions.
- We did not find any claims regarding source-availability and found [0 results](https://github.com/search?q=com.vowcurrency.vow&type=code) in GitHub Code search.
- This app is **not source-available**.
