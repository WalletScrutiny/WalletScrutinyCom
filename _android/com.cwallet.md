This app is an exchange based wallet and as such typically private keys are custodial, we can verify this from the [providers own site](https://xapawallet.com/#1603507874611-a20bac97-a1d1) , as they make a clear statement of how the private keys are managed.

> Where are my private keys?
> As XapaWallet is custodial, so your private key stores in Xapa Server with complex security.

Our Verdict: This "wallet" is custodial and therefor **not verifiable**
