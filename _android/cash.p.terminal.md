## Update 2024-07-03

After updating the script, we found that this app is now [source-available](https://github.com/piratecash/pcash-wallet-android). This app is now **for verification**. 

## App Description from Google Play

A powerful non-custodial multi-wallet for PirateCash, Cosanta, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Solana and other blockchains. Non-custodial crypto and NFT storage, onchain decentralized exchange, institutional grade analytics for cryptcurrency and NFT markets, extensive privacy controls and human oriented design.

## Analysis 

- A BTC wallet is available
- A 12-word mnemonic phrase is provided during startup. 
- We've verified their claim that this app is non-custodial. 
- The provider does not make any claims regarding source-availability
- A [search on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=cash.p.terminal&type=code) for the app ID does not show any results.
