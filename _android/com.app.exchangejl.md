## Updated Review 2023-08-30

It's been several months since we emailed krypterz and they haven't replied. We tested the app again on two platforms, and in both instances, it did not work. 

At this point, this app is **no longer working**.

## App Description from Google Play 

> Join us and start trading Carbon Credits (KPZ), Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Shiba Inu (SHIB), DOGE, etc.

## Analysis 

- We installed the app and was greeted with a message that reads:

> This app has been temporarily disabled by the publisher

- We sent an email to info@krypterz.com 
- For now, we'll keep this as a **work-in-progress** until more information is made available.
