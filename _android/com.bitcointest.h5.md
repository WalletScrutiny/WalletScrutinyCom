## Testing the App

We downloaded the app by a certain [Myrtis Alverson](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Myrtis+Alverson). 

The app asked for access to our phone's media and it also asked for access to 'manage phone calls', which we denied. 

It claims to be a non-custodial wallet, however, there is nothing to indicate that it is. 

There are two main languages for the app: English and Chinese. Registration is required and KYC is optional for higher tier membership.

When opening the app, the options are:

1. rechargeCoin
2. withdrawText
3. exchangeText
4. poolp1
5. coinPool
6. consumeRecord
7. service
8. futuresText

While testing, the app downloaded some files and updated itself.  

These are the choices under the 'My' menu option:

- Account change record
- Wallet address
- Bank account number
- Online customer service (links to Telegram, WhatsApp and their online customer service which is a chat interface)
- Helping center

### Depositing and Receiving

It is possible to send and receive multiple cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, USDT, ETH, LTC, BNT, XRP, DOT, LINK, FIL, DOGE, and more. 

### Trading

Under the 'Contract' option, it is possible to Buy/Sell various cryptocurrencies.

## Analysis 

We have some concerns with wallets that use only 'Bitcoin' as name. Without additional branding, it appears that it is marketing itself as **the official** Bitcoin wallet.

When we searched for the developer's name, 'Myrtis Alverson', the initial results that appeared indicated a deceased person. Other results pointed to an individual developer linked to cryptocurrencies with links to Chinese domains.

Apparently, the app is not yet complete as it would show a blank page when choosing some options. Yet despite this fact, there are now 388 reviews out of 1000+ downloads that are overwhelmingly positive. 

Most importantly, we were not able to locate backup or restoration options which are key indicators for a real self-custodial wallet. 

By co-opting the name 'Bitcoin' and not having specific branding related to it, lack of core self-custodial-wallet features such as backup or restore, with very suspicious ratings that look fake, we believe this app to be **fake**, too.
