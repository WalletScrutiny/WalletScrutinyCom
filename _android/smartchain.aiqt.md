**Update 2022-01-15**: This app is not available anymore.

## App Description

The full description is:

> Cypto, Bitcoin, NFTs, Market its all here. (link to binance/referer)

One of the negative reviews:

> [Hamid karimzadeh ghazijahani](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=smartchain.aiqt&reviewId=gp%3AAOqpTOGD1yMWrsKgYPCjsRa1c6UYafdDefQd8nqZWKc1UoncD8Rg30jpiHo0r0YhjRvxKP6srqYcYt9GxjPqKQ)<br>
  ★☆☆☆☆ August 19, 2021 <br>
      It's too slow and just a shortcut to website

Even the blogspot site linked in the description is completely empty.

## The App

This app just links to Binance. It's a referrer.

## Verdict

This is **not a wallet.**
