## Analysis 

- The app is for a cryptocurrency exchange.
- Like most exchanges, we observe:
  - KYC measures
  - Membership requires approval
  - Limits on transactions
- We were not able to find documentation whether the exchange used cold storage
- We installed the app and was greeted with this message (Translated from Spanish using Google Translate)
  > *For the moment the web platform is disabled. Likewise, our OTC table continues to operate to be able to give you a more personalized service and enjoy a better way of operating.*
- We were able to sign up on the website - but were then shown the same message above.
- With no proof the app provides the private keys to the user, we're marking this app as *custodial* which makes it **non-verifiable**.
