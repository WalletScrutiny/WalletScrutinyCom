## Analysis 

We had some difficulty translating the functions of the app as well as in signing-in. 

The old app is: 

- {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.bancryp.dmbank.user' verdict='true' %}

We'll update the information here as soon as we have the necessary information. Our support ticket number is #11852
