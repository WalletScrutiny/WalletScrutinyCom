## Analysis 

- Our connection to the site was sporadic, although we were able to connect eventually.
- We successfully registered with the service.
- We were able to find a P2SH BTC wallet that has deposit and withdrawal functions. A notice is underneath which informs us that:
  > Withdraw is disabled for this BTC coin

- The 'Security' option is limited to a 'Passcode' and '2FA'. 
- We can also add bank details, and verify our identities. 
- No mnemonic phrase was provided during app initialization. 
- There was no private key backup option in settings.
- As a centralized cryptocurrency exchange plus the information noted above, we classify this app as a **custodial** app.
