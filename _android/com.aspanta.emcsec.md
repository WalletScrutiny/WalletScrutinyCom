## App Description from Google Play 

> Emercoin Secure Wallet is an easy-to-use and lightweight crypto wallet based on the Electrum protocol. It currently supports two cryptocurrencies, Emercoin and Bitcoin, stored together in the same wallet.
>
> The wallet is:
>
> Secure, with private keys stored on the user device and the wallet itself protected with a seed phrase, and
Lightweight, as it does not need storing the blockchain.
>
> You can also use the wallet with your own Electrum servers.

## Analysis 

- We were able to install the app
- Emercoin and BTC wallets are available
- The seed phrases were provided 
- Emercoin has a GitHub [organization page](https://github.com/orgs/emercoin/repositories), but we were not able to locate the specific repository for the Android app.
- We [tweeted](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1656595602980089857) @emercoin_press just in case they could provide a link. 
- While we wait for their response, we'll tentatively give this app a verdict of **not having its source publicly available**.
