## Update 2024-07-17

If one searches for the app ID ["com.payperless.wallet" on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=%22com.payperless.wallet%22&type=code), you will not find any relevant GitHub Android repository or code. Despite the passage of time, this app is still **not source-available**.

## App Description 2022-04-11

The app is a multicurrency wallet with support for Bitcoin. 

The wallet can be funded through credit card, debit card, bank transfer or cryptocurrency exchange.

It also supports Biometric authentication. 

## Verdict 

Once the app confirms the phone number of the mobile device, the user is asked to create a pin code. A 12-word mnemonic phrase is created which can be exported. 

There was **no mention that the project is open source**.
