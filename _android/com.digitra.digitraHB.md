### [Terms](https://intercom.help/digitraglobal/en/articles/6155807-terms-of-use)

The word "custody" is found 5 times in the Terms

Regarding funds kept after the closing of the account due to fraud, violation of law or violation of these terms, the DIGITRA.COM shall keep full custody of the User’s funds and data/information that may be delivered to the governmental authorities in case of suspension/closing of the account as a result of fraud, violation of laws or the rules and policies of the Platform.

## Analysis 

We downloaded and installed the app but was not able to complete account verification steps due to many documentary requirements. However, it is clear from the Play store description as well in the terms and conditions that this is a **custodial** offering and thus, non-verifiable.
