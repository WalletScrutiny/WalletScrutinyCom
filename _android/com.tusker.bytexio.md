## Analysis 

- The homepage's title is "The Best Non-Custodial CeDeFi Wallet"
- The app can be connected to MetaMask
- Oddly, when we tried to register using our 2nd email account, it said that the email is already in use. So we used our first email account. It then gave password incorrect errors, which is odd since we double-checked. We clicked on "Forgot password" and then it sent an email to our 2nd email, with an invitation to join the platform rather than a "Forgot password" page.
- We tried this three times and it would seem that the registration system is broken. In the third try, the app gave an "Invalid Recaptcha".
- In the homepage of the app, it describes funds as stored in **cold-storage**, and military-grade facilities.
- We were not able to register with the service. 
- We'll go by the description which states that there are funds that are self-custodial (perhaps those linked via Metamask) and also, funds that are held **in their custody**. We'll mark this with the latter verdict as it is the more clearly stated.
