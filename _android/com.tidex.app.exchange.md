>
> Our platform has a great history, a highly effective tool combining all the qualities of modern centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, originating in 2017.

## Analysis 

- We successfully registered and signed in. 
- We found a legacy BTC address with deposit and withdraw functions.
- Since this is a centralized exchange, the mnemonic phrase was not given during app initialization. There was also no option to back up the private keys from the settings.
- They utilize [cold-storage](https://tidex.com/about-us) in the storage of user funds.
- This is the primary indicator of a **custodial** provider.
