      Scam exchange. They will never give you your coins. Pretending to work on the wallet for more than 9 months now.

## The Site

From the [Terms of Use](https://citex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018961991-Terms-of-Use), we see that it's possible for CITEX to terminate your account.

> The Company may freeze the member’s account and e-wallet without his/her consent when freezing the e-wallet is required for the investigation of national authorities such as investigation organs, the Ministry of Justice and administrative departments due to electronic financial fraud.

From Article 6 Application for users

> When information that is inconsistent with the fact or false information is provided or the information is found to be false later, the Company will suspend the membership service or permanently end or terminate the service contract. Any loss incurred to the Company and third parties thereof will be fully borne by the corresponding member.


## The App

We downloaded the app. It has the interface of an exchange, and allows you to enable 2-FA before you can withdraw. It lets you deposit BTC via a QR code and Bitcoin Address.

## Verdict

This exchange is **custodial** and therefore **not verifiable.**
