## Analysis 

This is the **companion app** to the {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/blockhww' verdict='true' %}. It requires an NFC-capable phone, otherwise the app would not be installed.

The setup process involves:

- Opening the app and choosing "Set up new wallet". Without the hardware device, it would not be possible to set up a new wallet. The alternate option is "More Options".
    - More Options:
        - If the user selects More Options, the user can: 
           - Accept an Invite to be a trusted contact (An invite code generated by a bitkey holder is required)
           - Recover your wallet. If the user is on Android, this requires signing in to Google Drive. 
           - Import your wallet. Use the user's Emergency Access Kit to import the wallet. There is a mobile key code that is stored in the Emergency Access Kit which can be inputted in a field.
           - The Emergency Access Kit is a PDF document located in the device's cloud backup. It can be scanned with a QR code, or the details can be entered manually.
- Pair the hardware device with the app using NFC (no initial charging required).

- Once paired with a bitkey HWW this product can function as a wallet.

### Recovery Options

Here are the available recovery options [offered by Bitkey.](https://support.bitkey.world/hc/en-us/articles/18801968949652-What-recovery-methods-are-available  )

## Verified Builds

This is the [documentation](https://github.com/proto-at-block/bitkey/blob/main/app/verifiable-build/android/README.md) for the build process for the Bitkey Android app, and these are the [preparation instructions](https://github.com/proto-at-block/bitkey/blob/main/app/verifiable-build/android/README.md#prep-work).

## Update 2024-07-26 for version 2024.63.0 (4)

1. The existing bitkey script needs the build to be on a local machine connected via USB to a phone with Bitkey installed. It is cumbersome and crashes.
2. To address this concern, we will modify [`verify-android-apk`](https://github.com/proto-at-block/bitkey/pull/4/files#diff-40973f2588da23cffda3526ed003b4759acc3b1bbfc72b7a0e9ae64f5310486f) and [`convert-aab-to-apks`](https://github.com/proto-at-block/bitkey/pull/4/files#diff-f10be429543ced172e8edc9340113f28bc613622bd438fe59f3302ab9acf7db1). 
3. Proceeding with the build, we cloned the repository locally and executed `steps/download-apk-from-phone`
4. We uploaded the folder containing the split apks to our build server.
5. With the modified files, we proceeded with bitkey's instructions to [prep.](https://github.com/proto-at-block/bitkey/tree/main/app/verifiable-build/android)
6. We then execute: `./verify-android-apk -d /path/to/apk/directory -s /path/to/device-spec.json /path/to/bitkey/repo /path/to/build/directory`

## Analysis of the diffoscope results:

### arm64_v8a.apk
   
   Of particular interest is the human-readable portion of the diffoscope results:

   ```
   ├── AndroidManifest.xml (decoded)
   │ ├── AndroidManifest.xml
   │ │ @@ -1,6 +1,4 @@
   │ │  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

   │ │ +  <application android:hasCode="false" android:extractNativeLibs="false"/>
   │ │  </manifest>
   ```

This segment shows that Google added this line: `<meta-data android:name="com.android.vending.derived.apk.id" android:value="2"/>`

Digging a little bit deeper, we find that:

> Apps that are signed by Google will have a 'derived APK ID' written into their AndroidManifest.xml file.

[Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44689959/androidmanifest-xml-file)

This is further elaborated [here:](https://medium.com/@nimi0112/google-play-app-signing-to-secure-your-app-keys-883ab9996f18)

  
> Modifications to your APK
> 
> Apps that are signed by Google will have a “derived APK ID” written into their AndroidManifest.xml file. You’ll see a meta-data element added under the application tag that references <meta-data android:name=”com.android.vending.derived.apk.id” android:value=”[ID]” />.
>
> This ID is the identifier of the modified APK and will be reported in the usual bug reporting tools. You can use the derived APK ID to recognize a specific APK that was delivered by Play.
  
### base.apk

There are signing-related differences. Similar to the diffoscope output for arm64_v8a.apk, There are additional meta-data information which is present in the official apk but not in the built apk. 

    <meta-data android:name="com.android.vending.derived.apk.id" android:value="2"/>
    <meta-data android:name="com.android.stamp.source" android:value="https://play.google.com/store"/>
    <meta-data android:name="com.android.stamp.type" android:value="STAMP_TYPE_DISTRIBUTION_APK"/>
   

### en.apk
   
Apart from the signing differences. We find the same addition plus the namespace made to the official (Google Play) apk's AndroidManifest.xml: 

    <meta-data android:name="com.android.vending.derived.apk.id" android:value="2"/>

    xmlns:n1="http://schemas.android.com/apk/distribution" and attribute n1:splitTypes=""

### xxhdpi

Again, we find: 

    <meta-data android:name="com.android.vending.derived.apk.id" android:value="2"/>

    xmlns:n1="http://schemas.android.com/apk/distribution" and an attribute n1:splitTypes=""

## Notes on the Bitkey Build 

Bitkey acknowledges the difference between apks extracted from AABs. More about this can be read [here](https://github.com/proto-at-block/bitkey/blob/main/app/verifiable-build/android/README.md#verification-notes):

  > Although Google Play should be using bundletool, APKs extracted from an AAB differ in more than just a signature.
  >
  > As mentioned above, we noticed a mismatch between language APKs downloaded by Google Play and those produced by bundletool. We use the --connected-device flag when invoking bundletool build-apks, which should produce the same set of APKs. However, looking at the output of bundletool get-device-spec, the supportedLocales list is often missing some languages that Google Play downloaded to the device.
  >
  > Another such difference are names of extracted APKs. We use the normalize-apk-names-new script to rename APK files to matching names.
  resources.arsc mismatch

  > Until recently, once we normalized the APK names and contents, we could just run diff -r to check for identity. Unfortunately Google Play has changed how they build resources.arsc. From our testing, it seems like they are using a previously reserved byte. When built using bundletool, that byte is always 0, thus making direct comparison using diff impossible.

Most of the diffs produced stemmed from signing certificates and signatures. It is apparent that Google Play modifies the apk as seen with the addition of `<meta-data android:name="com.android.vending.derived.apk.id" android:value="2"/>`. From a "strict reproducibility" standpoint, this app is not-reproducible in the sense that it is bit-by-bit identical in the binary level. But, if we factor in the explanation provided by Bitkey above, and if we take cognizance of the fact that Google Play alters the apks distributed to the users, we can consider these as benign differences and give Bitkey the verdict of **reproducible**.
