## Analysis 

This is the **companion app** to the {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/blockhww' verdict='true' %}. It requires an NFC-capable phone, otherwise the app would not be installed.

The setup process involves:

- Opening the app and choosing "Set up new wallet". Without the hardware device, it would not be possible to set up a new wallet. The alternate option is "More Options".
    - More Options:
        - If the user selects More Options, the user can: 
           - Accept an Invite to be a trusted contact (An invite code generated by a bitkey holder is required)
           - Recover your wallet. If the user is on Android, this requires signing in to Google Drive. 
           - Import your wallet. Use the user's Emergency Access Kit to import the wallet. There is a mobile key code that is stored in the Emergency Access Kit which can be inputted in a field.
           - The Emergency Access Kit is a PDF document located in the device's cloud backup. It can be scanned with a QR code, or the details can be entered manually.
- Pair the hardware device with the app using NFC (no initial charging required).

- Once paired with a bitkey HWW this product can function as a wallet.

### Recovery Options

Here are the available recovery options [offered by Bitkey.](https://support.bitkey.world/hc/en-us/articles/18801968949652-What-recovery-methods-are-available  )

>  - [Cloud recovery](https://support.bitkey.world/hc/en-us/articles/18842210239764): Lost/Replaced phone with cloud backup available

## Verified Builds

This is the [documentation](https://github.com/proto-at-block/bitkey/blob/main/app/verifiable-build/android/README.md) for the build process for the Bitkey Android app, and these are the [preparation instructions](https://github.com/proto-at-block/bitkey/blob/main/app/verifiable-build/android/README.md#prep-work).

## Update 2024-08-28 for version 2024.67.0 (1)

- The build verification steps needs a phone to be connected to a local machine. Cloning the repository can fail if the https protocol is used. When running `$ git submodule update --init --recursive` multiple network errors are encountered:

  ```
  error: 3000 bytes of body are still expected
  fetch-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet
  fatal: early EOF
  fatal: fetch-pack: invalid index-pack output
  fatal: clone of 'https://github.com/eerimoq/detools.git' into submodule path '/home/dannybuntu/work/builds/world.bitkey.app/2024.67.0-1/bitkey/firmware/third-party/detools' failed

  error: RPC failed; curl 92 HTTP/2 stream 0 was not closed cleanly: CANCEL (err 8)
  error: 664 bytes of body are still expected
  fetch-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet
  fatal: early EOF
  fatal: fetch-pack: invalid index-pack output
  fatal: clone of 'https://github.com/SiliconLabs/gecko_sdk.git' into submodule path '/home/dannybuntu/work/builds/world.bitkey.app/2024.67.0-1/bitkey/firmware/third-party/gecko-sdk' 
  ```

Verification can be quite troublesome if the Internet connection of the user is not fast enough. 

- Once we were successful in cloning the repository, initializing the submodules and the rest of the prep work, we then tried to run the script: `app/verifiable-build/android/verification/verify-android-apk . verify-apk`

This resulted in errors related to version 17.0.12+7-1ubuntu2~22.04 of openJDK not being available in the Ubuntu repositories that the Docker image is accessing. We checked the repository, and found that the specific version is indeed not available. 

**Note:** As of version 2024.67.0.(1), the [modifications](https://gitlab.com/walletscrutiny/walletScrutinyCom/-/blob/master/_android/world.bitkey.app.md#update-2024-07-26-for-version-2024630-4) I made to Bitkey's script and methodology still apply. I have [submitted a PR](https://github.com/proto-at-block/bitkey/pull/4) to them.

## Analysis of the diffoscope results:

### arm64_v8a.apk
   
   Of particular interest is the human-readable portion of the diffoscope results:

   ```

    │ │  </manifest>
   ```

Like before, we find this segment shows that Google added this line: `<meta-data android:name="com.android.vending.derived.apk.id" android:value="2"/>`

Digging a little bit deeper, we find that:

> Apps that are signed by Google will have a 'derived APK ID' written into their AndroidManifest.xml file.

[Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44689959/androidmanifest-xml-file)

This is further elaborated [here:](https://medium.com/@nimi0112/google-play-app-signing-to-secure-your-app-keys-883ab9996f18)

  
> Modifications to your APK
> 
> Apps that are signed by Google will have a “derived APK ID” written into their AndroidManifest.xml file. You’ll see a meta-data element added under the application tag that references <meta-data android:name=”com.android.vending.derived.apk.id” android:value=”[ID]” />.
>
> This ID is the identifier of the modified APK and will be reported in the usual bug reporting tools. You can use the derived APK ID to recognize a specific APK that was delivered by Play.
  
## Notes on the Bitkey Build 

Bitkey acknowledges the difference between apks extracted from AABs. More about this can be read [here](https://github.com/proto-at-block/bitkey/blob/main/app/verifiable-build/android/README.md#verification-notes):

  > Although Google Play should be using bundletool, APKs extracted from an AAB differ in more than just a signature.
  >
  > As mentioned above, we noticed a mismatch between language APKs downloaded by Google Play and those produced by bundletool. We use the --connected-device flag when invoking bundletool build-apks, which should produce the same set of APKs. However, looking at the output of bundletool get-device-spec, the supportedLocales list is often missing some languages that Google Play downloaded to the device.
  >
  > Another such difference are names of extracted APKs. We use the normalize-apk-names-new script to rename APK files to matching names.
  resources.arsc mismatch
  >
  > Until recently, once we normalized the APK names and contents, we could just run diff -r to check for identity. Unfortunately Google Play has changed how they build resources.arsc. From our testing, it seems like they are using a previously reserved byte. When built using bundletool, that byte is always 0, thus making direct comparison using diff impossible.
  >
  > Since resources are important part of the application, we're using aapt2 diff to check for differences between APKs from device and from bundletool.

Most of the diffs produced stemmed from signing certificates and signatures. It is apparent that Google Play modifies the apk as seen with the addition of `<meta-data android:name="com.android.vending.derived.apk.id" android:value="2"/>`. From a "strict reproducibility" standpoint, this app is not-reproducible in the sense that it is bit-by-bit identical in the binary level. But, if we factor in the explanation provided by Bitkey above, and if we take cognizance of the fact that Google Play alters the apks distributed to the users, we can consider these as benign differences and give Bitkey the verdict of **reproducible**.
