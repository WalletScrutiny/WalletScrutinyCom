## Analysis 

This is the **companion app** to the {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/blockhww' verdict='true' %}. It requires an NFC-capable phone, otherwise the app would not be installed.

The setup process involves:

- Opening the app and choosing "Set up new wallet". Without the hardware device, it would not be possible to set up a new wallet. The alternate option is "More Options".
    - More Options:
        - If the user selects More Options, the user can: 
           - Accept an Invite to be a trusted contact (An invite code generated by a bitkey holder is required)
           - Recover your wallet. If the user is on Android, this requires signing in to Google Drive. 
           - Import your wallet. Use the user's Emergency Access Kit to import the wallet. There is a mobile key code that is stored in the Emergency Access Kit which can be inputted in a field.
           - The Emergency Access Kit is a PDF document located in the device's cloud backup. It can be scanned with a QR code, or the details can be entered manually.
- Pair the hardware device with the app using NFC (no initial charging required).

Without an NFC-capable phone, and the hardware wallet, this app would not be able to function on its own. This solidifies its designation as a companion app. Therefore, it is **not a wallet** on its own.
