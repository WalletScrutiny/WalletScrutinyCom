## Analysis

- We signed up with the service using our email address.
- Once signed-in, we were presented with multiple cryptocurrency wallets and their prices.
- We were also provided with a Bech32 BTC address. Deposit, withdraw, buy, and sell options were available.
- This [page](https://yibi.co/en/help_detail/74/3) talks about account recovery in case the mobile phone, email address or password has been lost.
- The provider sets [arbitrary limits](https://yibi.co/en/help_detail/36/3) on the amount that can be withdrawn. Before an amount is withdrawn, the service processes this and the transaction undergoes a review. If it is "too high", the transaction may not be approved by the manual auditor.
- We did not find any option to backup the private keys.
- Though we can't find any statement whether the platform uses cold-storage, statements that have to do with transactions and the control the provider exerts on these, give us reason to judge this as a **custodial** provider.
