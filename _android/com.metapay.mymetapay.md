## Analysis

- Registration only required an email address. 
- We were able to find a field with a BTC logo, but they only presented a QR code with a "UID" and did not have an address. Scanning the QR code from another BTC wallet results in this:
  >  {"account":"daniel.walletscrutiny@gmail.com","sub_symbol":"BTC", "uid":"1000109720"}
- No identifiable BTC address presented in a text string was given. 
- The User Agreement can only be found in the app and does not contain much information about the wallet. 
- There was also an option to buy. But it was not accessible and the app asked us to verify our "real name identity" first. 
- We are somewhat placed in a quandary whether to label this as "custodial" or as not a wallet for bitcoin. On one hand, the QR code in the field with a BTC logo, did not even provide a BTC address of any sort but a user ID. The other bitcoin apps that we tried to scan the QR code simply gave an error. 
- On the other hand, presuming that the app does have capabilities to accept Bitcoin, it definitely is a custodial app because no private keys were given. 
- With no user guide and sparse documentation in the user agreement which can only be read from the app, we will mark this app as **not a wallet for bitcoin**.
