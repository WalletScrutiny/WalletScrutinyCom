> Trusted by over 300,000 traders around the globe, Atani enables you to securely buy and sell thousands of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and much more, across the world's leading exchanges - all from a single account, and getting always the best price.
>
> With Atani, you can also manage your portfolio across multiple exchange accounts and wallets, trade with advanced trading, charting and technical analysis tools, receive price alerts, and automate your tax reporting. All for free.

## Description of Service from Website

> Atani uses AES-256 to encrypt all data corresponding to your API Keys and other operational data within the app. This allows us not only to protect your data, but also to maintain the highest level of data security within our no-custody policy. After all, your data should always be on your PC under your absolute control. This ends up giving you greater peace of mind, especially when protecting against attacks that could expose your data publicly.

## Analysis 

- Atani describes its service as [non-custodial](https://blog.atani.com/get-to-know-the-security-measures-in-atani-application/).
- Once installed, the app asks us to verify our identity. The interface shows multiple exchanges such as Huobi, Kraken, Binance, bit2me, etc. 
- Its motto is "one account, all exchanges"
- Users can connect to their Binance or some other cryptocurrency account using their API Key and Secret Key. 
- In short, Atani is an aggregator of exchanges. This proves their claim of being non-custodial and thus, **not providing a wallet to their users**.
