## Analysis 

- Bitpanda also has a custodial service, found at custody.bitpanda.com. 
- The app was geo-restricted so we were not able to install. 
- These are the [transaction fees](https://www.bitpanda.com/en/limits) that the platform charges for various cryptocurrencies.
- According to this document, assets are held in [cold-storage](https://www.bitpanda.com/en/security) facilities and audited by third-parties. 
- As a custodial provider, the app is **not-verifiable**.
