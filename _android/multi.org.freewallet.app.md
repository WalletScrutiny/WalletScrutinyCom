The [Free wallet website](https://freewallet.org/) clearly states to the user how the wallet private keys are managed.

> Сustomers’ private keys are kept by Freewallet. Lost private keys or mnemonic phrases don’t mean lost funds. Your account can be retrieved via your email like on any other service.

We do not need to research any further for our verdict.

Our verdict: This 'wallet' is custodial and therefore is **not verifiable**.
