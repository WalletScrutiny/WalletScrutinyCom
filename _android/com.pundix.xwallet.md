**Update 2022-01-06**: The app is online again.[( Twitter Screenshot)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1479004151375822850)

**Update 2021-06-16**: It's been a few days this app is not on the App store. If
it should return, please open an issue on our issue tracker!

Searching the Pundix [support FAQ](https://support.pundix.com/) we find an FAQ that answers the private key management question.

> **Will I have a private key when setting up an account in XWallet app?**<br>
  No. Your email address and mobile number are required when setting up an XWallet app account.

The wallet does not provide the user access to the private keys.

Our verdict: This 'wallet' is custodial and therefore **not verifiable**.
