## Analysis 

- The developer contact website is no longer online 
- The last archive of the site was in [2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210624081537/https://www.xyt.com/)
- The app purports to show an update with the notification "update: There is a new version, is it updated? It included Chinese characters as labels + the word "BUG". We downloaded this update. 
- During registration, and when clicking on User Terms, the app goes to a zendesk page that says "Oops, this help center no longer exists"
- Back to the app and in the registration page, it asks us to enter the verification code from a non-existent image. 
- With this, we can say that it is no longer possible to sign-up. 
- We have sufficient grounds to give this app a verdict of **defunct**
