  ★★☆☆☆ September 24, 2021 <br>
       Cannot create a backup due to it crashing... Not able to transfer my coins out of this wallet due to signature issue. Scared to even attempt uninstall and reinstall waiting for new update hopefully this gets resolved soon.

### The Site

The terms of service can only be found on the app prior to "Create a new wallet" or "Import a Wallet". Curiously, we cannot find a link to this terms anywhere else on the site or online. We endeavored to make a [pastebin of the Terms](https://pastebin.com/HtC4CnEy) that are copied verbatim from the app as of September 30, 2021.

Some pertinent provisions:

> **Services**<br>
The Wallet Application enables users: (i) the self-custody of their digital assets, meaning, we do not store your private key on your behalf; 

### The App

We installed the app both on Blue Stacks and on a Samsung Phone. Upon opening you have 2 options:

- Create wallet
- Restore or import existing wallet

Both require 24-word seed.

After that, there were no KYC measures or ID verification. A BTC wallet is available by scrolling down and tapping on "Add Asset"

It is possible to send or receive BTC from the app.

### Verdict
The 24-word seed phrase is for the entire wallet and not just specifically for bitcoin. 

We found a repository for the code and [Emanuel](https://walletscrutiny.com/authors/emanuel/) made [an issue on Github.](https://github.com/FunctionX/fx-wallet-android/issues/1)
