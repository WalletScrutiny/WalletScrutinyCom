## App Description

The app is described as a cryptocurrency trading and portfolio management tool. It also allows the importation of third-party cryptocurrency exchange APIs and wallets.

> - Connect your exchange API accounts to Coinigy and trade directly through a single app.
> - Automatically import your portfolio from all major cryptocurrency exchanges and hundreds of wallets.
> - Live streaming price and orderbook data, powered by Coinigy CryptoFeed™
> - Curated cryptocurrency news updates provided by Coinigy's NewsWire service
> - One-time setup and your portfolio is available across all your devices, including web.
> - Customizable interface, you choose what you want to see.

## The Site

In the section dedicated for Security entitled, [_"What security is in place for Coinigy?"_](https://support.coinigy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001135114-What-security-is-in-place-with-Coinigy-)

> **Coinigy never handles your funds directly**.  All funds remain stored in the exchange's wallets.

## The App

Upon download and registration we proceeded to find the wallet section. We cannot find it. The '**Portfolio**' section gives you the ability to add an exchange account. We assume that you can check your balances in that exchange after inputting the API keys.

## Verdict

This app **does not have a bitcoin wallet**.
