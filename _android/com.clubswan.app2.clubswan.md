## Analysis 

- We were able to successfully install the app, but not fully register since it would require subscribing to any of their user tiers. 

In the terms it is stated: 

> All monies funded to Your Accounts are held in segregated custodial pooled accounts on Your behalf at one of Nvayoâ€™s banking partners and can be redeemed at any time upon request for the current monetary value held, subject to our fees, local laws and exchange regulations. 

- This is a **custodial** provider.
