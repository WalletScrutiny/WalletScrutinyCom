## Analysis 

- We installed the app, and it opened a browser to a website. 
- The interface was pretty crude which allows the user to "sell bitcoin" by inputting some numbers, for the provider to exchange to fiat presumedly, to deposit to the user's bank account. 

We did **not find a wallet** in this app.
