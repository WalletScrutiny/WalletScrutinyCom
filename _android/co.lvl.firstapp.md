## App Description
LVL describes itself as a "premium all-in-one finance app that lets you buy and sell crypto for free." It claims to be a community exchange:

> Buy and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin with no trading fees and no hidden spreads. With LVLâ€™s revolutionary community exchange, the only price you pay is the price other LVL members are charging.

## The Site
At LVL's [page on cryptocurrencies:](https://www.lvl.co/service/how-to-buy-crypto-without-fees)

> At LVL, you get your own fixed-address wallet **using multi-signature security technology provided by BitGo**. Multi-signature technology creates multiple layers of security with no single point of failure.

BitGo offers custodial services, meaning that LVL probably does not provide users with the mnemonics.

## The App
We tried the app and registered an account. Unfortunately, our region was not supported, so we could not view the app's features.

## Verdict
This app is **custodial** and thus **not verifiable.**
