**Caution:** Cloud mining apps that run on a phone with no reference to a mining facility and require referrals are generally shady projects that are not really into mining. Users are cautioned regarding apps like these.

## App Description

> All mining processes are made by Cloud servers. Internet connection on your device is all that requires to start.

> You are offered in a bitcoin miner game that allows you to feel like a real crypto investor.

Several users report being unable to withdraw even after reaching the threshold limit, with others saying that they had lost all of their coins after an update.

The developers reply with a comment saying:

> Support team please contact us through this email to ensure your payment suport.bitcoin.cloud.mining@gmail.com


Additionally, another 1* review calls this a scam.

      Have you noticed your battery dies quickly using this 1. Drains battery (reguardless what they say) 2. Full of pop up ads continuously 3. Go between tabs to personal ref samsubg s10 black screen crashes 4. Did you use resources checker whilst using app. 🤔 for them reasons im unistalling is fake possibly key logger and all no way this legit

We recommend users to exercise caution around apps like these.

## Verdict

The developers claim that satoshis are stored on the server, and users are not allowed to withdraw until they have reached a certain threshold. There is simply no proof that this is true. Since there is no functionality that allows users to send or receive bitcoins, this is **not a bitcoin wallet.**
