## App Description

From its website:

> "A small Android helper enabling payments to email-like Bitcoin Lightning addresses from unsupported wallets."

## Analysis 

This app takes a Lightning address and generates the corresponding invoice, so you can send payments using wallets that donâ€™t natively support addresses.

There are no seed phrases, or wallets with balances. It closes after the explanation screen. In the explanation screen, users can tap on a sample address and an interface similar to sending sats appears. Users can enter any amount. This is **not a wallet**.
