## Update 2024-07-17

As of this update, ZenaPay removed references to being a bitcoin wallet from its Play Store description. Ethereum is the only currency shown. Despite the mnemonics, we are marking this app as **not a bitcoin wallet**.

## Previous Review 2022-12-09

ZenaPay is a bitcoin and ethereum wallet.

> Everything related to Bitcoin is stored securely on your device. It's a highly secure encrypted solution to make sure that your funds are safe.

This is a clear claim to be self-custodial.

As we could not find any source code, this app is **not verifiable**.
