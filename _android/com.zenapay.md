## Update 2022-12-09

We re-tested the app and found that only an Ethereum address is generated. We do not know if this is a bug or an intended behavior. We did not test the app further.

## Previous Review 2022-12-09

ZenaPay is a bitcoin and ethereum wallet.

> Everything related to Bitcoin is stored securely on your device. It's a highly secure encrypted solution to make sure that your funds are safe.

Nowhere in the app description is it mentioned whether ZenaPay is a custodial wallet or not. We searched the website for more information concerning the wallet:

> ZenaPay’s app provides a safe digital wallet for storing, sending, receiving, and purchasing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. ZenaPay’s user-friendly interface facilitates the management of all your passkeys and transactions.
>
> Users can send, receive, and buy their preferred cryptocurrency from the point-of-sale value easily and securely.

However, we did not receive a clear answer. We installed the wallet and were provided with the choice to either create or restore a wallet. When creating a wallet, you are provided with a 12-word passphrase after setting a pin for your account. To restore the wallet, you must enter the 12-word passphrase.

The providers did not link to a GitHub profile nor confirm if the source code was made available for review. While the wallet itself is self-custodial, it is **not verifiable.**
