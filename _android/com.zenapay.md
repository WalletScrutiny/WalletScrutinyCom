## Previous Review 2022-12-09

ZenaPay is a bitcoin and ethereum wallet.

> Everything related to Bitcoin is stored securely on your device. It's a highly secure encrypted solution to make sure that your funds are safe.

This is a clear claim to be self-custodial.

As we could not find any source code, this app is **not verifiable**.
