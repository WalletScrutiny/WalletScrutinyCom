## Analysis

- We tried to sign up with the service but an [image](https://x.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1831590368154153256) displaying "Verifying Your Number" persists after tapping Register via WhatsApp. When it tried to send an OTP, we did not receive it via WhatsApp or sms. 
- The site does not list its website, but the domain could be found in its email address. It is rovi.network. We visited the link and found this: 

> ROVI Network and ROVI Dapp is merged with HABIT Network - world's 1st L3 solution for everyday use-cases in Gaming, Commerce and Entertainment. $ROVI token is delisted from Probit Exchange. See announcement on X and join HABIT community for latest updates.

Among the choices was to join the [$HABIT network](https://www.habitnetwork.xyz/).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ROVIans Community - ROVI started its journey as a humble yet innovative crypto Rewards Dapp and listed its Dapp utility token in Jan 2023 on Probit, when the entire Crypto industry existence itself was being questioned :-). 1/10</p>&mdash; ROVI Network (Official) (@rovi_protocol) <a href="https://twitter.com/rovi_protocol/status/1795774521431015755?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

Its token has been delisted in ProBit. 

Since we were not able to access the other functions of the app, and with the announcement telling us that users are encouraged to join a different company, this app may be on the road to being **defunct**
