## App Description from Google Play

> Digital Money is the easiest way to buy and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum and Tether instantly at the best rates with zero fees

## Analysis

- We installed the app and found an option to add a 'BTC account'. 
- No mnemonics or options to back up the private keys were found.
- The exchange discloses in its [whitepaper](https://dmexchange.com/doc/DMTOKENWHITEPAPER.pdf) that it uses a system of hot and cold wallets to manage user funds. 

The exchange is a *custodial* service with a **non-verifiable** app.
