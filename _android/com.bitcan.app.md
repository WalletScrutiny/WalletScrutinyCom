>

## The App

We downloaded the app and registered. We then tried looking for the private keys. 

Note that Bitkan has on several occassions referred to private keys in these articles:

[Institutional Custody Will Challenge Retail-Oriented Crypto](https://bitkan.com/news/topic/555748), [What are Private Keys and Why Are They Important](https://bitkan.com/zh/news/topic/377326) and [Proof of Keys: A critical Test for bitcoin](https://bitkan.com/news/topic/552254).

Despite these articles, we were not able to locate any information pertaining to the keys on their platform. The articles merely referred to them as educational material.

## Contact

Absent credible proof or documentation where the private keys are stored, we reached out to [Bitkan via Twitter to ask](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1451073356900405248).

## Verdict

While waiting for their reply, we are going to assume that as the keys are not actually accessible or viewable at the moment. In that case, we are compelled to mark this app as **custodial** unless there is further update or clarification from the providers. Thus, this app is **not verifiable.**
