## App Description 

The app is still in development.

> Use the ZENIQ Wallet to manage your digital assets.
>
> Send, receive and hold over 100 coins and tokens in a closed Peer-to-Peer system.
>
> ZENIQ supports ZENIQ Coin (ZENIQ), Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum (ETH), and many ERC-20 tokens.  

## Analysis 

The app has the appearance of a self-custodial app that supports Bitcoin. It is possible to backup and recover a wallet using a 12-word mnemonic. There are no references to the project being Open Source. We **could not find a linked public repository** for the app's source code.
