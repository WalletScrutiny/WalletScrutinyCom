## Analysis 

We installed the app and was greeted with the option to create or restore a wallet. Seed phrases were provided. When we're finally in the app, we were not able to find a BTC wallet. What's supported are the following: 

- SHAH 
- BNB
- USD 

Emblazoned in the header section of the app is "Binance Smart Chain". 

This app **does not have a BTC wallet.**
