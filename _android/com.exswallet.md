## Analysis 

- We installed the app 
- It provided a 12-word mnemonic phrase
- However, we were not able to find BTC support despite the inclusion of Bitcoin in the Google Play description. 
- We emailed their support at miraqle@miraqle.io and await their response. 
- We also [tweeted](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1661286705620475904) them.
- Meanwhile, we shall designate this is an app that **does not offer BTC support**.
