### Notes

Unfortunately, at the time of this review, the site is inaccessible.

## The App

We are given the option to create or restore a wallet by typing a 12-word backup phrase.

When creating a wallet, we are asked to provide information such as name, email, and "referrer email" to join a referral program. We must also set a password to protect the new wallet.

> Cannot connect to server. Please try again later or contact support for help.

You get the same message when trying to restore a wallet.

## Verdict

This wallet may look **self-custodial**, however at this moment we are unable to access any of its services. Until any further update or new information, our verdict for this app is **defunct.**
