## Analysis 

- UpBots allows users to sign in and then key-in their cryptocurrency exchange API keys 
- There is a UBXN token that is ERC-20 based, options to connect Metamask, Binance Chain, and other DEX wallets are also present. 
- The UBXN can only be deposited as it is supposed to be used for the operation of the app. 
- Basically, this is a trading bot app and performance and the UBXN is meant to serve as fees.
- This app **does not serve as a wallet**.
