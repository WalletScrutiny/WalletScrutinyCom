## Analysis

- The app's listed developer website is offline.
- The first options after installation were: 'Wallet creation' and 'Wallet restoration'
- We then inputted a password.
- We then backed up the 12-word mnemonic phrase and confirmed.
- We then agreed to all terms.
- We skipped basic information: DOB, address, mobile number, mobile authentication and gender.
- We restarted the app, and the primary asset in the main interface is 'Elysium-G'. Ethereum and Ripple are also available. Clicking on the plus sign at the top right showed: Elysium Token, Cushion Token, Litecoin, Ripple, Qtum, Dash, Bitcoin Gold and Ethereum.
- There is **no BTC wallet**.
