## App Description from Google Play

> Welcome to the World’s #1 cryptocurrency platform ! Fox Exchange: the simple, safe way to store, trade your cryptocurrency. The leading cryptocurrency exchange for you to build your portfolio, earn yield, stay up-to-date on crypto news and navigate the crypto market with ease - whether you’re just starting your crypto journey or are a seasoned expert.

## Analysis

- For an app that has 50000 downloads, it is strange that it has very little functionality - and even includes Google Ads replacing the entire screen in some parts of the app.
- The app has **no BTC support** [(Screenshots)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1674756756558290945). It only has Fox coin and Wolf coin. Under 'Upcoming assets' it has: Bee Network, Grove Coin and Bing Coin.
