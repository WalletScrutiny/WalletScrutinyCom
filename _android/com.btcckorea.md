## App Description from Google Play 

> JetFinex safely keeps all of your assets (KRW, passwords) securely and protects your assets and clearly separates your assets from your operating assets.

## Analysis 

- The website associated with the app is no longer online
- When we tried to install the app, it stated: 

> The app isn't available for your device because it was made for an older version of Android 

- From the app description, the offline website, and from the obsolete nature of the app, this can be designated as **defunct**. Other than that, we can glean that it was custodial.
