## App Description

> Frontier makes it extremely easy to:
> - Create a new crypto wallet in simple, easy steps
> - It is secured, non-custodial, and only you have access to your private keys, giving you complete control of your funds
> - With your new wallet, you get access to 13+ blockchains:
> - Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche C-Chain, Solana, Algorand, Harmony, Zilliqa, Bluzelle, TomoChain, Elrond, Band Chain, Binance Chain and Kava
> - Swap, stake, lend with your crypto wallet in one app.

## Verdict  

The app starts off by letting user create a passphrase for the entire wallet. Once that is done, a 12-word mnemonic phrase is provided. 

It has wallets for the assets mentioned above, but there was **no Bitcoin wallet**.
