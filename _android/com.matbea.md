## Verdict 

The platform avoids the use of the word custody and as evidenced by the conversation with their support, they claim to not have the private keys - this is not realistic. The wallet is generated through their site, and we were not able to find any options for restoring or backup of the private keys. This is a **custodial** provider and the app, therefore is **not verifiable**.
