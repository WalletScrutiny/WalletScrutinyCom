## App Description
> Vera Wallet is the official crypto wallet of VeraFTI. 

The official site linked in Google play, verafti.uk returned a DNS error that the site could not be found.

## The App
We tried the app. We were given the option to import an existing wallet or create a new one without having to sign up. After choosing to create a new wallet, we are told to set a password and then given a 12-word mnemonic.

Unfortunately, we could not find an option to create a **BTC** wallet.

## Verdict
Due to a defunct website and lack of information on this app, we cannot go into further research regarding this app. It **does not support bitcoin.**
