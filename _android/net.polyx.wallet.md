## Documents

[Section 9.2.](https://polyx.net/public/docs/EN_Polyx_Terms_site.pdf) pertains to all intellectual property assets owned by the company.

## Analysis 

- We installed the app, but got a blank screen on BlueStacks 5 Android 9
- We also tested this on an Android Studio emulator API 29 and got a similar result. 
- When on an actual device, the app just keeps going back to the 'Secret Phrase' screen after confirming the phrase. 
- After trying several times, we decided to just contact the developers via their listed address at wallet@polyx.net
- Assuming the app descriptions are accurate, the probable verdict for this app could be **source-unavailable**. However, since it was recently updated, we'll keep this as a **work-in-progress** until more information comes at hand.
