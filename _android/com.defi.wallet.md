## Update 2024-07-16

Almost three years after, a search for the app ID "com.defi.wallet" on GitHub only yields a library called "[defi-wallet-core-rs](https://github.com/crypto-com/defi-wallet-core-rs)" and not a buildable Android app. Their policy concerning the public availability of their Android app's source code has not changed.

## Review 2021-10-24

This app's description is promising:

> Decentralized:
> - Gain full control of your crypto and private keys [...]

On their website though we cannot find any links to source code.

Searching their `appId` on GitHub,
[yields nothing](https://github.com/search?q=%22com.defi.wallet%22) neither.

This brings us to the verdict: **not verifiable**.

The provider has a family of three apps that we triple-checked to be linked from
their website:

* {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.crypto.exchange' verdict='true' %}
* {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/co.mona.android' verdict='true' %}
* {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.defi.wallet' verdict='true' %}
