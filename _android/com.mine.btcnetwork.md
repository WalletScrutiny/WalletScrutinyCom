## App Description from Google Play

> Satoshi Exchange App is the up-to-date and fastest-growing cryptocurrency, with Satoshi being mined daily. Start earning bitcoins with the most up-to-date cloud mining technology for crypto coins. Stop wasting time with other cloud mining tools and instead use our Satoshi Exchange. Bitcoin Miners is a one-click solution that lets anybody earn money from anywhere in the world. You only need to use the app once a day to mine bitcoins for four hours without exhausting your phone's battery.

## Analysis

- The app's listed developer contact is a free blogspot page.
- The app's only sign up option is via Google.
- We clicked the sign in button.
- The main interface has three options: Start, Play Quiz and "Predication" (sic)
- Clicking on 'Start' brings us to another screen with a balance of Satoshis. There are no noticeable "Deposit" or "Withdraw" options. We tapped on the button and a timer started to "count satoshis", starting from 0.001 Satoshi. It looks like an ordinary timer.
- This app **does not have a wallet**.
