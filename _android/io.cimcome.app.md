## App Description

> COINCOME Wallet is a cryptocurrency (digital currency) wallet app that allows you to send, receive and manage CIM, Ethereum, and ERC20 tokens.

COINCOME is a non-custodial wallet that is meant for managing "CIM, Ethereum, and ERC20 tokens."  

Here is the list of supported currencies:

> CIM / ETH / USDT / BAT / QASH / DEP / LINK / BNB / HT / MKR / CRO / OKB / ENJ / CHZ / WBTC / UNI / COMP / USDC / THETA and more

As BTC is not included, and this wallet advertises itself as a wallet for managing **tokens,** we have reason to believe that this **wallet is not for bitcoin.**
