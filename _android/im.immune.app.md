## Review 2024-07-20

We did not find any relevant repository when searching for the [app ID on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=%22im.immune.app%22&type=code).

Moreover, there's a warning when we attempted to browse their website:

> Firefox detected an issue and did not continue to imm.app. The website is either misconfigured or your computer clock is set to the wrong time.
>
> It’s likely the website’s certificate is expired, which prevents Firefox from connecting securely.
>
> **What can you do about it?**
>
> imm.app has a security policy called HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), which means that Firefox can only connect to it securely. You can’t add an exception to visit this site.
>
> The issue is most likely with the website, and there is nothing you can do to resolve it. You can notify the website’s administrator about the problem.


## App Description from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.immune.app&gl=us) 2023-04-15

> IMMUNE contains all the usual messenger functions:
- Sending text and voice messages
- Voice and video calls
- Sending and receiving files of any type
- Sending and receiving images and videos
- Sending and receiving contacts from the address book
>
> The IMMUNE crypto wallet allows you to:
- Store bitcoins on the mobile device
- Transfer bitcoins to other people by phone number or a wallet address
- Buy bitcoins with credit card payment (not available in all countries)
- Restore the wallet using a secret phrase when reinstalling the app or changing the phone number

## Analysis 

The app has a Bitcoin wallet that can send and receive. It also provides the seed phrases. However, we were **not able to find a publicly available source** for the Android app. Thus, this app **cannot be verified**.
