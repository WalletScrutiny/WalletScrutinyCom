## Review 2024-07-20

We did not find any relevant repository when searching for the [app ID on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=%22im.immune.app%22&type=code).

Moreover, their website's ssl certificate expired three months ago, which suggests the project might be abandoned.


## App Description from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.immune.app&gl=us) 2023-04-15

> IMMUNE contains all the usual messenger functions:
- Sending text and voice messages
- Voice and video calls
- Sending and receiving files of any type
- Sending and receiving images and videos
- Sending and receiving contacts from the address book
>
> The IMMUNE crypto wallet allows you to:
- Store bitcoins on the mobile device
- Transfer bitcoins to other people by phone number or a wallet address
- Buy bitcoins with credit card payment (not available in all countries)
- Restore the wallet using a secret phrase when reinstalling the app or changing the phone number

## Analysis 

The app has a Bitcoin wallet that can send and receive. It also provides the seed phrases. However, we were **not able to find a publicly available source** for the Android app. Thus, this app **cannot be verified**.
