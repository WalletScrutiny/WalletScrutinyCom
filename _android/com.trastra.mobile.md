In its [user agreement](https://trastra.com/user-agreement/), it states under the heading "The Services" that:

> On our Website, we arrange provision of the Wallet and the payment Card, facilitated by our partner(s), in order you could buy, sell and manage supported cryptocurrencies, as well as apply for, manage and load money onto a Trastra payment card.

Bitgo is the third party provider. 

All indications by far indicate that this is a **custodial** service and therefore **not verifiable**.
