## The App

This is evidently a self-custodial app.

Upon opening CardWallet, the user is given the option of creating a new wallet or importing a pre-existing wallet via a seed phrase.

When we chose the option to create a new wallet, we were provided with a 15-word mnemonic. The app then confirms if you have secured the phrase, and then advises the users to store the mnemonic in a secure place.

It has BTC support which can send and receive. It can also backup and restore the wallet.

## Verdict

A search on GitHub for the appID `fi.cardwallet` [yielded 0 results](https://github.com/search?q=fi.cardwallet.android). A search for 'CardWallet' on GitHub however yielded [29 repositories](https://github.com/search?q=cardwallet&type=repositories). [We messaged](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1455769560099946496) [@CardWallet_fi](https://twitter.com/CardWallet_fi) for details and until they reply, this app's **source cannot be verified**.
