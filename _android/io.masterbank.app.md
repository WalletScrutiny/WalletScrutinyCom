## Analysis 

- The app doesn't seem to be working. It [merely displays the logo](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1631236142724186116).
- There is an [announcement](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1631235108501073920) on the main website to an end of service, yet the app has recently been updated on February 27, 2023. The announcement reads:

> Masterbank stage 1
>
> Thank you to all the users who joined our service.
> The Masterbank stage 1 will be terminated according to the information below. So, Please submit digital asset withdrawal within February.

With a non-working app, and a broken registration system that requires a referral code to sign up, and with no documentation, we can only guess what this app really does. As the announcement vaguely implies, the provider seems to be sunsetting the service. 

Without more concrete information, there are no indications that this is a **Bitcoin wallet**.
