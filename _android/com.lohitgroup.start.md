## Analysis 

- The listed website is no longer online.
- The last known [archive.org entry](https://web.archive.org/web/20200813021701/http://lohitgroup.com/) with useful information dates back to 2020. 
- We were able to install the app but it gave an error right after start up: 

> Network 
>
> Network problems

- Several factors lead us to conclude that this app is already **defunct**. We were able to locate the value of [LHO token](https://etherscan.io/token/0xAC65dc06C8444C6545A94Ce961496258Aa860Cb9?a=0x086d521ead6ef2d2e609728d87c2216f8ff59ee4), with a fully diluted market cap of $0.00. The non-working app and website all point to a project that is no longer active.
