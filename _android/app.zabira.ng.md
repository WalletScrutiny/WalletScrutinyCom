## Analysis 

- We signed up for the service and found a P2SH BTC address with "buy, sell, send and receive" options. 
- We tapped 'buy', but an error message appeared:
  > Apology for the inconvenience, buying of bitcoin is unavailable for now.
- There were no seed phrases provided. 
- The security options consisted of 2FA verification, KYC, password reset, pin management, phone verification and biometrics. 
- The absence of provisions for the private keys, lead us to conclude that this is a **custodial** platform with a **non-verifiable app**.
