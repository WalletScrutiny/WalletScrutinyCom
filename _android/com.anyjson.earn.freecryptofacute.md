       spam and virus full of links. Adult xrating links start poping like crazy, covers the whole screen. It's someones personal app for referall linking.

       I uninstalled it because it duplicated another faucet and faucets it contained tend to be clumsy.
       
## Analysis 

- The homepage listed on Google Play is no longer online 
- We installed the app on our BlueStacks5 Pie 64-bit. It showed the splash screen, a few coin symbols, but then after that, nothing. 
- We installed it on our phone and it seems to show a list of referral sites. 

This app **does not have a wallet**.
