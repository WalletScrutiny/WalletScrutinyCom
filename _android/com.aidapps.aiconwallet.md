## Analysis 

- It was difficult to register through the mobile because of language barriers. 
- We tried authenticating via a mobile phone number but it returned an error: **"Please proceed with authentication"** and **"Enter the phone number format only by number"**. We followed instructions and only inputted numbers, but it gave the same error. 
- We tried to register again via the web app over at ios.ai-dcloud.com/join. We received the same error. 
- We will contact them in the hopes of clarifying the features for their app. 
- We emailed hello@aicon.online and await their response.
