The app allows you to trade BTC but it is only an exchange and not a wallet.

From their website:
> We provide our customers with access to cryptocurrency trading through Apex Crypto. Apex Crypto is not a registered broker-dealer or FINRA member and your cryptocurrency holdings are not FDIC or SIPC insured.

> You can buy and sell cryptocurrency on Webull. However, we do not support transferring crypto into or out of your Webull account at this time.
