       **Translated:** Worst. I am calling him but the call center does not work.
       
The website isn't provided in the Play Store. The provider is also named [P2P Options](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=P2P+Options) and this is their only app.

## The App

From the User Agreement on the app:

> We may terminate the Agreement or your P2P Options account, you may simply discontinue using our Services.

The app gives you the option to choose a demo account or a real account.

There are "Trade coins" with the app claiming one Trade coin = $1 USD. 

There's an option to deposit crypto to buy these Trade coins, but you receive a message saying that "Something went wrong." 

You can see the list of pending transactions. Clicking one will show you a QR code and BTC address, but the transaction immediately expires. It is impossible to deposit BTC.

One of the tabs shows the most recent trades. The latest one was from August 25, 2021.

## Verdict

Until further notice, we classify this app as **defunct.**
