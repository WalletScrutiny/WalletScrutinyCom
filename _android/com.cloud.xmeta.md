## Analysis

- We downloaded the app and found:
  - A multicoin wallet provided by the platform
  - A BTC/USDT trading pair where users can either buy or sell
  - A BTC wallet, with a legacy address, where users can store BTC.
  - Security options include:
    - SMS Authenticator
    - Google Authenticator
  - Identity Authentication
  - Provision for Withdrawal Address

- We were not able to find any option to backup the private keys of the app.
- The absence of the private keys makes this a **custodial** app.
