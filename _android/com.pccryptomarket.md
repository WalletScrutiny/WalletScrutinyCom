## Analysis

- [Screenshot](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1663835605325709313) 
- We installed the app, and tried to access the wallet, but when we clicked it, it redirected us to a Cloudflare.com error: 

> Error code 521 
>
> - Browser working 
> - Cloudflare working 
> - pccryptomarket.com (Host Error)
>
> The web server is not returning a connection. As a result, the web page is not displaying. 

Since the both the app and the website no longer work for more than 3 years, we consider this as **defunct**
