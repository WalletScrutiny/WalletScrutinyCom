## Updated Analysis 2023-08-17

There is a warning emblazoned on the header of the site.

<div class="alertBox"><div>Please pay attention: we have been informed that fraudsters are using the Elyps name to perform scams. The only trustable domain for our websites and email addresses is elyps.com. Please send us an email at support@elyps.com if you have been contacted.</div> </div>

- We will try to email them again.

## Analysis 2023-05-24

- We cannot install the app as its registration is by invite only and geolocation-restricted
- We did not find any reference to 'Bitcoin' or 'crypto'  
- We will email them to ask for more information at: hello@elyps.com 
- We'll keep this as a work-in-progress until more information is available.

## Update 2024-01-09

We have not received any response from them since May 2023. Without any sort of response on any of the emails we sent, and with no proof that this app supports bitcoin or crypto, we will be marking this as an app with **no wallet**.
