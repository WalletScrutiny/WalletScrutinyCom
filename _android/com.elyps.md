## Analysis 

- We cannot install the app as its registration is by invite only and geolocation-restricted
- We did not find any reference to 'Bitcoin' or 'crypto'  
- We will email them to ask for more information at: hello@elyps.com 
- We'll keep this as a work-in-progress until more information is available.
