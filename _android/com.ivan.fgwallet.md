## Update 2024-07-17

We can see in this app's [repository](https://github.com/Chainbytes/FGWallet) that it is a fork of [Bread Wallet Android](https://github.com/breadwallet/breadwallet-android). The repository has not been updated since [March 2018](https://github.com/Chainbytes/FGWallet/commit/0750eaffbe233aa9621e3c6146c4f0d3cdcea329). Meanwhile, their Google Play was [last updated May 2024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ivan.fgwallet). This makes the app **not source-available**.

## App Description 2022-06-30

> An ultra-secure multi-cryptocurrency wallet that supports BTC, ETH, XRP, ADA and ERC-20 tokens. Your private keys never leave your device. Strong wallet encryption and cryptography guarantee that your funds will remain safe under your ultimate control.
