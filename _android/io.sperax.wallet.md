       Hi, i don't know if there is a bug or something.. but in the last month almost all the time i can not activate the XP mining.. it's just remaining offline. I can see the "Start" button only 1 second when i go to the "Earn xp" menu, and after 1 second it is disappearing

        After the new update, i lost all my xp and referral friends!! Edit: I re-downloaded the app after a few months and then it says "We have stopped supporting users from your country due to legal reasons." This app is a joke and a scam if you put some money in it.

It is described as a multi-currency wallet however, we were not able to verify if it has a BTC wallet because they're not open to new registrations. 

We also did **not find corroborating information that it supports BTC**.
