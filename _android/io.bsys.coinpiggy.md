## App Description from Google Play 

> COINPIGGY Wallet is an electronic wallet that can easily and securely manage various cryptocurrencies and we are expanding the service area to the crypto asset platform.

## Analysis 

- The website shows a login screen with a download button. 
- Warning! Clicking on Download, redirects to a domain called last7080.com. The file that's supposed to be downloaded is named 'LastClientSetup.exe'. We do not know what this file does.
- We installed the Android app and the Terms and Conditions page is an html error but it is still possible to proceed by clicking 'Agree'
- We were then given a 12-word mnemonic phrase - but the boxes where the phrases are supposed to be are empty. 
- The next button leads us to confirm - but without the words, we can not confirm. 
- The app which was last updated in 2020, is no longer working properly. The website just leads to a suspicious domain with a suspicious file. It is prudent to assume that this app is already **defunct**
