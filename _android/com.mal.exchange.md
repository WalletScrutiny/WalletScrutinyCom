## Analysis

- [(Screenshots)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1678698472617267201)
- The app's language is primarily in Arabic.
- Some deposit functions require KYC before we are able to access it.
- We tried looking for Bitcoin deposit, but could not find it. ([Searching for 'BTC'](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1678698472617267201/photo/3) in what we assume to be the deposit screen returns empty)
- It is possible to trade BTC with USDT.
- [Withdrawal of BTC](https://doc.mal.io/en/fees) is possible because the platform lists BTC withdrawal fees of 0.0005
- Some clues from the [Terms:](https://doc.mal.io/en/user-agreement)
  - Section 5.2 - About the capacity of the provider to suspend/terminate the user account.
  - Section 5.8 - The provider refers to generally ensuring the security of the user account.
  - Section 11.2.1.2 - About the capacity of the provider to report the details of the user account to authorities
- While the provider does not explicitly discuss its security mechanisms, most of the clues indicate a **custodial** service. We were also not able to find any mechanism for the user to backup the private keys.
