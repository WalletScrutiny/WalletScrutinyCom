## App Description

This Nigerian and Ghanan-focused app allows users in the "buying, selling, storing, sending, receiving, converting between cryptocurrencies, booking flights, shopping online with nationwide delivery and bill payments."

## The App

When we were finally able to register and log in to the site, we were greeted with a message that the wallet feature is ["coming soon"](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1460159363566346241) and is not currently available. Users should [provide their own bitcoin wallet addresses](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1460158731660922885/photo/1) if they're going to buy. Contrary to the content written on its app page and website, they currently have **no wallet**.
