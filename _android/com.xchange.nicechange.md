User account details (including account balance) between the app and the web service are synchronized. 

Wallets are provided:

>  
> NiceChange service provides its users with the ability to store digital assets on the internal balance of the account. Crypto Asset Storage on the account balance significantly speeds up the exchange process. To work with be sure to read the account balance about the benefits of using and Terms of use.

We were not able to locate backup and restore functions. 

### AML compliance

This service [undergoes AML procedures](https://nicechange.net/en/rules/):

> Wallet addresses of all transactions carried out on the NiceChange service undergo automatic AML verification.

## Verdict

A bitcoin wallet can be replenished and funds can be withdrawn. The service provides for an "internal wallet" that does not have provisions for backup and restoration. We believe this app provides a **custodial** service.
