> Hello. This is Team Coinone. Currently, foreigners cannot use the Coinone app, so we recommend using a web browser to use the Coinone service. We apologize for any inconvenience.

It's a Korean app and is not available in English. As the support stated, *foreigners will not be able to use it.*

> Coinone maintains 85% of cold wallets to protect customer assets more safely.

As it's an exchange and there's nothing to suggest otherwise, it is safe to conclude that Coinone is a **custodial** exchange and therefore **not verifiable**.
