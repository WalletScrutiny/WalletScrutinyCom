## Analysis 

- The terms of use of the site is currently blank 
- When we tried to register using the app, it returned an error: 

> "Server returns error"

- We sent an email to helpdesk@banq.com to inquire about their app. 
- The app was last updated in 2021 and their website seems to have shifted focus:

> Easily integrate end-to-end crypto and fiat mobile UI flows into your app with the Banq KYC, Buy/Sell Crypto, Crypto Deposit/Withdrawal, and Fiat Deposit/Withdraw SDKs. Banq provides mobile SDKs on top of Prime Trust APIs for easy integration of all the crypto and fiat funding services your business needs.

- We sent them an email over at helpdesk@banq.com
- For now, we'll retain this as a **work-in-progress**.
