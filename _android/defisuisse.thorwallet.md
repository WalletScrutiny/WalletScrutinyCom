## Analysis

- The seed phrases were provided during startup.
- There is a bitcoin wallet that can send and receive.
- This is a self-custodial wallet that does not describe itself as a source-available project. However, we were able to find a repository that is very likely to be the [repository](https://github.com/chj-damon/thorwallet-react-native) for the app. Updates were last made 2 years ago however. We also could not find a link from the website.
- In consideration of the facts stated above, we deem this project is **not source-available**.
