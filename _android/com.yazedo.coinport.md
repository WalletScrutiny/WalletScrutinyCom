## App Description from Google Play 

> Chat with the approved offer requester then do the cash money-cryptocurrency exchange in the agreed public place face to face.

## Analysis 

- This app is similar to {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.localbitcoins.app.android' verdict='true' %}
- The user is asked to provide GPS information. 
- The website is no longer online 
- The user can then list a possible trade (to buy/sell) with a pin in the local map. 
- We did not find a wallet within the app. Moreover, since the website is no longer online, and the app doesn't perform its major purpose. We believe this app is already **defunct**
