## App Description from Google Play 

> Instantly buy and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, & over 100 cryptocurrencies
with our beautiful trading and portfolio tracking app.

## Analysis 

- We tried to install the app on Bluestacks 5 Nougat but was informed that it needed an older Android version.
- We installed it on BlueStacks 5 Pie, but during registration it kept giving an error: "Email already in use". We used multiple email addresses.
- This app was last updated in 2018, so it is very old.
- The domain listed for this app is no longer online.
- We emailed the developer email at contact@chiba.exchange
- The email bounced because of an address not found error. The address was the developer contact. 
- With the factors listed above, we believe this is already defunct.
