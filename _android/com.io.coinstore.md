## Analysis 

Like most digital asset exchanges, CoinStore requires KYC prior to enabling access to more advanced features. We were able to access the BTC wallet via the 'Assets' menu option. It is possible to deposit and withdraw. 

We were not able to find an option that allows the user to back up the private keys. Furthermore, the BTC wallet is already generated upon registration. We tried to find documentation pertaining to how CoinStore handles the private keys but were not able to find any information about this. This is expected in custodial exchanges.  

All of these are indications that this is a **custodial** service.
