## Analysis 

The implication of having a cold wallet controlled by LUNA, is that they hold the private keys to this bitcoin wallet. However, we were not able to test this since we cannot register with their service. 

Since the website is no longer online [(Domain for Sale)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1649253062257807360), we cannot find any other information apart from the description. 

We'll mark it as **defunct** and a work-in-progress as more information becomes available.
