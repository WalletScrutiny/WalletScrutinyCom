## App Description from Google Play

> COINLORD is a Cryptocurrency marketplace in India. You can Buy and Sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and many more in India using COINLORD Cryptocurrency Exchange App. You can easily deposit INR using IMPS/UPI/ NEFT/RTGS/ Credit or Debit Cards.

## Analysis

- [(Link to CoinLord's Terms and Conditions)](https://coinlord.org/terms-conditions)
- We were able to register by using a temporary Indian phone number.
- Once inside, we found a BTC wallet, but its public key starts with 0x:
  > 0x3c8774667713f6073949699684f0b87bb417a319
  
  Which is not a Bitcoin address. The app apparently is selling "wrapped" Bitcoins on some other chain as actual BTC.
- We took a look at other funding options:
  - Instant UPI
  - UPI
  - Bank Transfer
- We could not find any option to backup the private keys. Initially, we thought this app was straightford as a custodial exchange. However, the BTC address format is mysterious as it is not in the usual P2SH, Legacy or Bech32 formats.
- We [tweeted](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1678349179188396032) them about it.
- Apart from this, key indicators in the terms and conditions do point to a custodial service:
  - Section 11. Ability to terminate user account and access
  - Section 12. Right to modify site's contents at any time.
  - Limitation of users to [Indian nationals](https://coinlord.org/faq)  
  - KYC requirement prior to withdrawal.

## Conclusion

- It was difficult to give this app a verdict because it is not so clear why the BTC address is not in the correct format. However, there is a BTC withdrawal option apart from bank withdrawals.
- The crucial element of this verdict is the lack of an option to backup the private keys, which corroborates a **custodial** verdict.
