## App Description from Google Play

> SecuX Mobile App supports management of digital assets on SecuX hardware wallets. SecuX hardware wallets are equipped with an Infineon SLE solid Flash CC EAL5+ Secure Element chip to securely store your PIN and Private Key offline, and authorize transactions without the private key ever leaving the device.

## Analysis 

This is the companion app to the SecuX family of hardware wallets:

- {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/secuxstonew20' verdict='true' %}
- {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/secuxstonev20' verdict='true' %}

The app cannot function without a paired hardware device. Therefore, it does **not function as a wallet**.
