## App Description

The app describes that the private keys are stored on the user's device. It allows staking and features support for multiple cryptocurrencies.

## The Site

### Terms and Conditions

The [Terms](https://www.protonchain.com/terms/) has a provision on termination:

> In the event of termination concerning your license to use Proton Wallet, your obligations under this Agreement will still continue. **Your access to the funds in your Wallet after termination will depend on your access to your backup of your Wallet address and private key.**

## The App

Upon app installation, registration and verification, the first thing to do was to create a backup for the private key. The private key was provided. We tried to import it into Electrum, and was successful. 

## Verdict

We checked the repository of the [Proton on Github](https://github.com/ProtonProtocol/) but were unable to find the source code for the Android App. Our verdict details a self-custodial app with **no source code.**
