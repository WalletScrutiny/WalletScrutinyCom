## Analysis

- The app [can send and receive](https://support.quidax.com/hc/en-us/sections/360004837011-Send-Receive-Cryptocurrency) bitcoins.
- Link to the [Terms and Conditions](https://www.quidax.com/c/terms-of-use/)
- The use of cold-storage mechanisms means that the provider holds the private keys on behalf of the user. This is a **custodial** app.
