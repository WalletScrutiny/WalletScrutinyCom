## Analysis

- We registered with the service and proceeded to buy BTC.
- The app's primary language is French, but the denomination is XOF. This is the currency in Burkina Faso. XO - is the 2-letter country code, while F, stands for Francs.
- The other payment options include Orange Senegal and Free Senegal.
- Despite the language and the mention of Francs, we believe this app caters to states situated in West Africa.
- Once we inputted a simulated amount, the app asked us to input a BTC address. We assume that the provider will send the BTC to that address.
* The app **does not have a wallet** and merely accepts fiat to send to the user's BTC address.
