Binarium is a mobile trading app where the user tries to predict
the movement of an asset and earn if the prediction is correct.

Fund deposit is available via SkyPay (Visa), QIWI, webmoney, iomoney, Perfect Money, bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, ripple and others.

Once Bitcoin deposit is selected, a BTC address is generated by the app. However, no apparent method of finding or extracting the private keys is available. 

We inquired via email, with a specific question about whether we can have the private keys, and to date, there has been no reply.

[The FAQ on withdrawing funds](https://binarium.global/main/faq) :

> verification is mandatory for submitting a withdrawal request. It is a guarantee that your funds won't become fraud or money laundering target.

There is a 24 hour "processing time" for BTC withdrawal requests.

This service is **custodial**
