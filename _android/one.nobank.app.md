## Analysis 

- We started and tried to choose a network. There is only Polygon, Harmony, ZkSync
- An option to connect via WalletConnect is present.
- After 'creating a wallet', we were asked to provide a 6-digit code. 
- No mnemonics or seed-phrases were provided.
- Despite their claims of supporting BTC, we simply could not verify this.
- Moreover, their terms and conditions page as of 2023-08-09, is [blank.](https://www.pierwallet.com/terms)
- We **could not find a bitcoin wallet on the bitcoin network**.
