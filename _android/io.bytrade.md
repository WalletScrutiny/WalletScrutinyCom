## App Description from Google Play

> ByTrade.io is committed to becoming the worldâ€™s leading crypto asset trading service provider, providing our global customers with the most safe, stable and efficient crypto asset trading services. 

## Analysis 

- We were able to register successfully. 
- The app did not provide a mnemonic phrase or provide options for backing up private keys. 
- We did find a bitcoin wallet, but only the BEP20 network is available. Bitcoin on the BEP20 network is tokenized bitcoin and not 'real' bitcoin. We [tweeted](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1682361398855348224) the provider to verify our findings.
- Until this is clarified, we'll mark this app as **not supporting real bitcoins.** Normally, an exchange would be custodial primarily because the service provider holds the private keys. But support for BTC on the bitcoin blockchain takes precedence, so we'll keep the verdict until further clarifications are made.
