## Analysis 

- This is a cryptocurrency exchange with some P2P market functions. They also provide multicurrency [wallets](https://www.vircap.io/faq#wallet). 
- Vircap explicitly states that it stores all private keys for the wallets they provide to users in their [terms.](https://www.vircap.io/terms-of-use)

Platforms that store the private keys for their users are **custodial**, and their app is **not-verifiable**.
