## Analysis 

There are no claims regarding this app's source availability.

Assuming all their other claims are true, we could not locate the Android app's [app ID in GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=%22com.crypto.ab.wallet.app%22&type=code). 

This app's **source is not available**, and thus the app is **nonverifiable**.
