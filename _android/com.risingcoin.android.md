## App Description from Google Play

> RisingCoin uses a consensus mechanism called proof of stake where the validator’s node is expected to stake some amount of coin to become a validator. Why stake coin?: Though RisingCoin network does not remove staked coin when a validator tries to validate a fraudulent transaction but such node is baned from the network and the account removed.
>
> General Validators Node: Every account holding at least 1 RSC is running the RSC validators node. This background node is so light that the system or mobile device of the user doesn’t feel anything; the work of this node is just to check and validate transactions chosen randomly by the consensus protocol.

       Worse app. It always shows that 'Update now' my app is already updated nt able to mine. So I uninstall the app after 2 weeks, again install bt the issue is same. Worst app.

       Hmmmm, wonders shall never end. Haven't used the app for months and have mined some coins, suddenly I can't access ♿♿♿ the app anymore. What an incidence, saying can't connect to server.

## Analysis

- The web app allows users to connect via Metamask or Walletconnect.
- We tried several times to register, but kept receiving an error:

   > Network Error: Unable to connect to the network

- Since we cannot register with the app, we are left to analyze it based on information available on its description and website. The project seems to be specific to their own token (RSC) which is on the BSC blockchain. We find **no indication that it supports BTC**.
