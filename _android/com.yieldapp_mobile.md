### [Security](https://support.yield.app/hc/en-us/articles/360016027818-Are-Yield-App-s-wallets-insured-)

> Whilst the industrial-grade security of custodial and insured wallets is not in doubt, income is typically only generated once a user's assets are transferred from cold wallets to “hot” or “deployment wallets” that in many cases are owned or managed by uninsured third parties. Yield App wallets are not currently insured, please see our Security page for more information including our protection pools.
