OMPfinex is a trading platform which also advertises "demo capability." This app offers a web version [here](https://app.ompfinex.com/sign-in).

[It is capable of restricting services](https://www.ompfinex.com/en/pages/policies) from any offending users:

> 4. Authentication in OMPFinex is necessary and users are required to upload their correct and complete details, and in case of user abuse, OMPFinex can stop its services for the offending user and report violations to the competent authorities.

From the homepage:

> Register with OMPFinex right now and buy instant digital currency sales. Note that to buy and sell digital currency in the main market, you need to complete your authentication; But the possibility of buying and selling in the demo (trial) market will be possible immediately.

Here is what the page says on security:

> One of the major concerns of OMPFinex is the security of users' assets. OMPFinex keeps all its assets in a cold wallet for the security of its customers' assets. In cold wallets, the possibility of hacking users' wallets is almost zero.
 
As the providers claim to keep the customers' assets in a cold wallet, it's unlikely that the user holds the private keys. We can conclude this is a custodial wallet.
