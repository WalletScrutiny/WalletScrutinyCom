## Analysis

- [Deposits](https://help.sarwa.co/hc/en-us/articles/9187678253853-What-assets-are-my-funds-held-in-) and [withdrawals](https://help.sarwa.co/hc/en-us/articles/4407343150353-How-do-I-withdraw-funds-from-my-Sarwa-account-) are done through bank transfers.
- Cryptocurrencies can only be [bought and sold](https://help.sarwa.co/hc/en-us/articles/5267128984349-How-do-I-buy-sell-crypto-).

     > Once you place a sell order, the Crypto will be converted to USD and funds will then be available in your Trade account. 

- Sarwa works through a broker, Alpaca. Alpaca [works with custody](https://help.sarwa.co/hc/en-us/articles/5267147743133-Where-is-the-crypto-stored-) provider Fireblocks.
- This is a *custodial* provider which **does not allow its users to send/receive bitcoins** and other cryptocurrencies. It is therefore **non-verifiable.**
