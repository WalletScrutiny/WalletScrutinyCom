## App Description from Google Play

> KOINTRACK app is a simple, powerful, smart and secure crypto wallet for Bitcoin (BTC), TRON (TRX), Ethereum (ETH), Binance (BNB) and other cryptocurrency assets serving users worldwide.
>
> KOINTRACK is a centralised exchange and crypto wallet. KOINTRACK’s encrypted and secure architecture makes private keys and sensitive data available only on the user’s specific mobile device, as KOINTRACK utilizes the latest military-grade technology for encryption.

## Analysis

- The app claims to be [non-custodial](https://kointrack.com/products/crypto-wallet):

> Only you have access to your account data. Your keys, your cryptos. No KYC Required.

- We successfully registered and found a Bech32 BTC wallet address that can send and receive.
- The app did not provide the seed phrases during wallet setup.
- The app is a multi-currency wallet. We were not able to find any option to backup the private keys in the settings.
- In section 2, under 'Services' of its [terms](https://kointrack.com/terms-and-conditions), we find a contradictory message stating that the exchange provides online storage and custody of the user's assets.
- The service can also suspend and restrict the use of the app.
- Without the provision of seed phrases and any option to backup the private keys, its claims of being non-custodial is doubtful. Registration only entailed the provision of the first, last name, password and email address.
- For the reasons stated above, we give this app a verdict of **custodial**.
