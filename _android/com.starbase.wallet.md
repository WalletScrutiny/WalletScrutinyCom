## App Description from Google Play 

> StarBase is a non-custodial decentralized wallet that allows user to store and swap their cryptocurrency that is held on various blockchains. StarBase is open-source and has direct integrations with both PancakeSwap and UniSwap.

## Analysis 

- The app provided the mnemonic phrase and even individual private key backup for every coin it supports. This includes Bitcoin. 
- It claims to be Open Source, but there is no link from its website to a repository. We found the possible [repository](https://github.com/deploystarship/StarBase_android) nonetheless.
- This app is for verification.
