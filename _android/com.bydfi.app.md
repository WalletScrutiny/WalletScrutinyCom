## App Description from Google Play

> BYDFi includes over 400 crypto for spot trading, up to 200x leverage for derivatives trading. Also,offering a secure and engaging platform for traders, followers, project partners, and media to interact and trade various commodities.
> 
> BYDFi has multi-country licenses and permits. Also, it has taken a series of measures to safeguard users' funds, such as multiple security management of accounts, asset separation, **cold wallet** storage, and acceptance of supervision and audit by third-party institutions.

## Analysis 

Most centralized and "regulated" cryptocurrency exchanges use cold-wallet storage as a means to protect the user's funds from hackers. BYDFI uses this as well along with other security measures and is thus, **custodial**.
