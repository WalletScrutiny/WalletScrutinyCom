## Analysis 

- The app is geographically restricted so we were not able to install. 
- From the information page and description we can discern that this app allows users to trade cryptocurrency CFDs and not actual cryptocurrencies. 
- From this point of view, we determine this app to not be able to send/receive Bitcoin.
