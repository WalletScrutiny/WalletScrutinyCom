## App Description from Google Play

> Oduwa Trust Wallet is a decentralised wallet, where users can send & receive OWC, WOWC, OWDT, BTC, BNB.
>
> It allows you to interact with many blockchains without ever giving up your private keys or the passcode to your funds.

## Analysis 

- The app provided an 18-word mnemonic phrase during wallet creation.
- It supports a Bech32 BTC wallet. 
- They claim to be Open Source and have a GitHub link on their homepage. 
- We checked out the Oduwa [repository](https://github.com/ODUWAX/Android) for their Android app, but the last time this was updated was five years ago. 

Even though this app is **source-available**, the repository has not been updated for a long time that it no longer matches the app on Google Play. We would have labeled it for verification, but this has to be fixed first. We created an [issue](https://github.com/ODUWAX/Android/issues) in their repository to suggest this.
