At the onset, it would appear that it is a general investment site which trades shares, indices, metals, forex, commodities and cryptocurrencies.

However, they have a new offering called a ['Bitcoin Base Currency Account'](https://www.easymarkets.com/int/bitcoin-account-base-currency/). This service, which they call the Î¼BTC Base Currency Account, allows users to deposit, trade and withdraw in Bitcoin. 

Provisions for its cryptocurrency wallet are defined in Section 4.9.7 of its [Terms and Conditions](https://static.easymarkets.com/assets/assets/view/20210524-client-agreement-bvi-int-en.pdf)

> If  you  decide  to  deposit  funds  via  a  crypto  wallet payment method, you are bound by the rules and regulations of this service provider

The platform claims to charge no fees when trading, depositing or withdrawing bitcoin. They also have CFD trading. 

The platform is proprietary, **custodial** and therefore **not verifiable**.
