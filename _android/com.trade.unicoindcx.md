## Analysis 

- This is a Malaysia-based cryptocurrency exchange
- It has a [BTC/USDT](https://trade.unicoindcx.com/trade/BTCUSDT) trading pair.
- We were not able to find any explicit description to mark this as a custodial provider, but it has the hallmarks of one. Some clues: 
  - Section 11.6 of the [terms](https://www.unicoindcx.com/client-agreement) states that unverified clients may not withdraw cryptocurrencies.
  - Section 17.1. Provisions on illegal or suspicious transactions
  - Right to terminate
  - Section 9.9. They charge a "storage fee" for cryptocurrencies
- Perhaps, a hint of how they store their assets without explicitly mentioning cold-storage:
  > Stored in separate asset specific wallet making our customers crypto assets very secure.

Although no clear-cut language was used to describe a custodial service, the notes above do indicate a **custodial** exchange and thus, a **non-verifiable** app.
