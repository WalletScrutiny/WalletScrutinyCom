## The Site

We searched the site for any mention of private keys, but couldn't find any.

There are two kinds of wallets in QuantDart: Personal and Shared.

Here are [more details:](https://support.quantdart.com/support/solutions/articles/60000676364-what-is-personal-wallet-what-is-shared-wallet-)

> A personal wallet is an M-of-N multi-signature digital asset wallet. However, the client only requires a single signature in order to create a transaction. QD is taking care of the other signatures on behalf of the client.
> 
> A shared wallet is also an M-of-N multi-signature digital asset wallet. The shared wallet signature holders are other QD users who are chosen by the wallet owner.
>
> Both wallets are capable of M-of-N multi-signature support for the utmost in security and safety as it will provide:
> - Dividing up responsibility for possession of cryptos among multiple parties.
> - Avoiding a single point of failure, making it substantially more difficult for the wallet to be compromised.
> - M-of-N backup where the loss of a single seed doesn't lead to loss of the wallet.
> * QD is currently supported 2 of 3 multi-signature and will provide more options on the number of the M and N soon.

## The App

We tried the app and were greeted by the app's introduction pages. The third one had some more proof on the app being custodial:

> Custody <br>
> Using advanced security, our Custody Wallet is secured and protects your digital assets. We are regulated custodian under AIFC and provides industry's leading insurance to your assets.

## Verdict

This app is **custodial** and thus **not verifiable.**
