## The App

We downloaded and installed the app. However, phone verification SMS did not arrive.

## Verdict

We were not able to locate any information pertaining to seed, private key or mnemonics since we were not able to install the app. However, it should be noted that most self-custodial apps do provide tutorials on their how-to pages or FAQs. We contacted bitmama via [twitter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1455078269426884613) to ask whether the private keys are stored on their servers or on the users' devices. While we await their response, it is evident that this is a **custodial** service, making the app **not verifiable.**
