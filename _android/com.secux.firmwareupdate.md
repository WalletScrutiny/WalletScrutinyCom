## Analysis 

As the name implies the app only exists to update the firmware of SecuX devices. 

It is compatible with: 

- {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/secuxstonev20' verdict='true' %}
- {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/secuxnifty' verdict='true' %}
- {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/secuxstonew20' verdict='true' %}

This is **not a wallet**.
