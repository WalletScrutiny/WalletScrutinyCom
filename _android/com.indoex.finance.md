- Clicking on one of them brings us to the registration page. A verification email is sent.
- Once the email address is verified, registration is complete. 2FA is then set.
- There is a multiwallet account with a P2SH BTC address that can send and receive.
- Under the security tab, we have:
  - Pin
  - Google 2FA
  - Touch ID
  - Pattern ID
  - Anti-Phishing Code
  - Device Management
- We were not able to find any option to backup the private keys.
- There is a [wallet status](https://www.indoex.io/walletstatusdetails) page on the site, showing users whether a particular cryptocurrency is available or not.
