       Can't create an account, just shows a loading circle and no response. Wanted to get some wtk and hold in the wallet in this app but this makes me reconsider. I won't hold on an exchange so if this app doesn't work I won't buy...

       All the app does is spin it's wheels when trying to create an account. Loading forever with no server response. Absolutely worthless

## Analysis 

- This app is geo-restricted
- We downloaded an APK with the same version from a third-party
- We successfully installed but registration required KYC verification
- We were not able to register 
- Going by the description that the app can send/receive Bitcoin, we find no description stating that it is a self-custodial wallet. 
- The numerous controls the app has on who gets access to the app, (geo-restriction), and the KYC controls (including biometric), also give a hint to its **custodial** nature. 
- The whitepaper reads more like a business prospectus with general business information, and no mention of private keys or seed-phrases.
