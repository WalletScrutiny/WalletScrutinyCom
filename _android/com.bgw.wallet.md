## Analysis 

- The provider has a [PDF agreement](https://bgw-document.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/Custody_Agreement_en.pdf) for a custody agreement where in section 1.1 the user agrees that the provider becomes the custodian of user's funds.
- Registration was done via email. We were not able to find any option to display, backup or restore the private keys.
- This is a **custodial** provider which makes the app **not verifiable**.
