## Analysis 

- [(Screenshots)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1657304257098399746)
- We were able to successfully install and register with the service. 
- The app redirects to a browser and opens kcnet.app. This is where the app's functions are shown. 
- There is a Bitcoin wallet that can send/receive. 
- There was no option to backup the private keys. This wallet is accounts based. 
- Absent the option to access the private keys, this is a **custodial** service.
