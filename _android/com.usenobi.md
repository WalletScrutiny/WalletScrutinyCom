## App Description from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.usenobi) 

> NOBI is a simple and secure all-in-one app that makes it easier to buy, sell, and store cryptocurrencies

### Security 

> We partner with trustworthy and credible partners to produce the most optimum result. Additionally, we employ multi-layers of security measurements in the app, including two-factor authentication (2FA), PIN code, and account verification, so your account is totally secure.

### [Terms](https://usenobi.com/en/terms/#) 

> NOBI is authorized to monitor your account in the context of preventing criminal acts regulated by law.
>
> In the event of a suspicious transaction made through the NOBI service, NOBI has the right to terminate or block your NOBI Account and block transaction funds and delay the transaction to you, until notification from NOBI.

### Analysis 

The deposit function is disabled until the user complies with KYC procedures. We were not able to find options to restore or backup the private keys. This is a **custodial** platform and the app is **not verifiable**.
