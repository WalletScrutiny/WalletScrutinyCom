## Analysis

According to the deposit guide, [USD, USDT and INR](https://trexfx.com/en/depositWithdraw/deposit/depositGuide.html) are used to deposit via bank transfer.

[Withdrawal](https://trexfx.com/en/depositWithdraw/deposit/withdrawGuide.html) can be done via their Bind Bank card.

Since the platform allows users to trade cryptocurrency contracts or CFDs, no actual Bitcoin is transferred. Therefore, users may **not send or receive actual Bitcoins.**
