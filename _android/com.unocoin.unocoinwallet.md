This app appears to be the interface to a trading platform. The description on
Google Play does not talk about where the keys are stored but it links to their
website and there we read

> AES-256 Encryption
> 
> The address-private key pairs obtained are encrypted using AES-256, sealed in
  envelopes and stored in multiple safe deposit lockers.

which clearly means they have the keys and you don't. As a custodial service,
this app is **not verifiable**.
