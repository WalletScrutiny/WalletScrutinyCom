## Analysis 

From the site's [security policy:](https://proex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900000456566-Security-Policy) 

> The overwhelming majority of system funds are stored in offline, cold wallets. Only approximately 1% of blockchain assets are accessible in hot wallets for day-to-day platform operations. As an added protection, the cold wallets are not available from the platform or the platform servers. The funds in offline cold storage require manual intervention by several members of our management to access.

The presence of offline storage indicates that this is a **custodial** service.
