## App Description from Google Play

> Buy and sell cryptocurrencies and digital assets safely and quickly on TimeX, an industry-leading crypto exchange based in Australia. Trade bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and other popular crypto coins.
> 
> TimeX offers instant fiat deposits and withdrawals for Australians. AUD can be deposited directly to TimeX, where it is credited as AUDT – a blockchain token 1:1 backed by dollars, held securely in a regulated Australian bank account and audited regularly. AUDT can be redeemed for Australian dollars at a 1:1 rate and withdrawn back to your bank account in seconds.
>
> The safety of users’ digital assets and personal data is paramount. TimeX considers security its #1 priority and takes a range of measures to safeguard cryptocurrency held on the platform, including **cold storage wallets**, two-factor authentication, and notifications of activity on your account. These are designed to dramatically reduce the chance of a breach and, in the event of a problem, to alert users and address the issue as swiftly as possible.

## Analysis

The app description explicitly states that trading bitcoin is allowed and that cold-wallets are utilized to keep funds secure. Therefore, this is a **custodial** app that is **not-verifiable**.
