## Analysis 

The app is a crypto-rebate rewards program, which has its own PLU cryptotoken. When the app states that it's non-custodial, it's because users have to [connect to MetaMask.](https://support.plutus.it/hc/en-us/articles/4701908861213-How-to-stack-your-PLU-for-additional-rewards). 

[Withdrawal of PLU](https://support.plutus.it/hc/en-us/articles/360012845997-Withdrawing-your-PLU-Rewards) is only available via the website and not on the app as of December 14, 2023.

This app **does not support BTC**.
