## Analysis

- Link to the [Terms of Use](https://bitcastle.io/en/terms)
- After we registered, we were shown the main interface. We found a BTC deposit option with a legacy address.
- Withdrawal is only possible once the user account level is increased.
- Transactions are submitted to the platform.
- Although the platform does not mention cold-storage or whether they are in fact, custodians of users funds, there is no option to backup the private keys. This option is crucial in determining whether a provider offers a custodial service or not. This platform is **custodial.**
