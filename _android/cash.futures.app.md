## Analysis

We registered via email and upgraded our account to "Level 2" to enable crypto deposits. Here, we discovered that the "BTC" wallet was based on "BTC-BEP20". This is the token standard for the Binance Smart Chain and not actually based on the Bitcoin blockchain. 

This app supports multiple cryptocurrencies but **not actual Bitcoin**.
