## Additional Notes

Opolo has a [kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/opolo-sarl/opolo-secure-crypto-wallet-for-the-eternal-peace-of-mind) which claims that it is an open source project.

## Verdict

The project claims to be an Open Source project. However, when we checked their [repositories](https://github.com/OPOLO-1/test-opolo-integration), "Test-Opolo-Integration" seems to be the one related to their hardware wallet. The other repositories are forked from various sources: 

Forked: 
- bitcore
- dashcore-p2p
- pidcodes.github.com
- f055-tuples
- slips (Satoshi Labs Improvement Proposals)

Unknown repository: 
- spy-usb-comm

The Android app itself **does not have the source publicly available**.
