       Problem in log in... User ID and password showing wrong...... And registered mail also shows wrong user.. 😑

## The Site

The site points to a free domain hosted on sites.google.com. It only contains a few paragraphs detailing its 'Privacy Policy'

## The App

There's no register option.

## Verdict

No website, no registration, a lot of user complaints about registration, this app **simply does not work.**
