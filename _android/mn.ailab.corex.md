## Analysis 

- Spot trading of [BTCUSDT](https://www.corex.mn/trading/btcusdt) is available.
- Section 4.3.4 of the [Service Agreement](https://www.corex.mn/service-agreement) explicitly informs us that the platform controls the private keys for storing user's funds in online and offline wallets. This is enough to determine this app as a **custodial** platform that's **non-verifiable**.
