## App Description from Google Play

> - Buy & Sell digital assets
> - Store digital assets on your phone
> - Support multiple blockchain (ETH, Binance Smart Chain, BHO chain, Polygon)
>
> Wallet
>
> - Create a new wallet or import your existing wallet in 3S Wallet. Your phone is converted into a highly secure wallet, where the wallet's private keys and assets are always in YOUR control (No one else can access your wallet)

## Analysis

- We backed up the private keys but the only chains available were ETH, BSC, BHO and Polygon. Only tokenized "bitcoin" is available. Therefore, **no bitcoin wallet** is in this app.
