The app has a short Play Store description:

We downloaded the app and were able to access the BTC wallet. It has capabilities to send and receive Bitcoins via a public address or a QR code. The app however, did not generate a mnemonic or a seed phrase. There's also no option to create a backup. Furthermore, the service requires KYC and identity verification for different user levels. This is indicative of a custodial service.

However it noted in [its whitepaper](https://hagglex.com/docs/hagglex-whitepaper.pdf) that it will be offering a non-custodial wallet as well as P2P trading in the near future.

Pending the release of their non-custodial app, this app is **custodial** and thus **not verifiable.**
