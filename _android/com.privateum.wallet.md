## Analysis 

- There is a link to an Apple store app, but leads to a blank page.
- We were given the option to Create a New Wallet or Add Existing Wallet
- We were given the 12-word mnemonics 
- We initially saw $PVM, $PRI, $USDT and $BNB 
- Tapping on 'Manage Networks' where the default is Binance Chain, leads us to a blank screen with no other option. This disallows the usage of the Bitcoin chain, and thus, Bitcoin support. 
- We tweeted [@privateum](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1663859816270376961) about this potential bug.
- This could go either of two ways: no source-availability or no support for BTC. For now, we'll keep this as a **work-in-progress** until they respond.
