**Update 2023-12-02**

Not much has changed since we last tested this app. We do not see however, any Bitcoin support on this app.

**Previous Review 2023-05-31**

## App Description from Google Play 

> Privateum Wallet is the official digital assets and crypto wallet of Privateum Initiative platform. You can send, receive and store Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies and digital assets safely and securely with the Privateum Wallet mobile app.
>
> Keep your private key secure with bank-level security

## Analysis 

- There is a link to an Apple store app, but leads to a blank page.
- We were given the option to Create a New Wallet or Add Existing Wallet
- We were given the 12-word mnemonics 
- We initially saw $PVM, $PRI, $USDT and $BNB 
- Tapping on 'Manage Networks' where the default is Binance Chain, leads us to a blank screen with no other option. This disallows the usage of the Bitcoin chain, and thus, Bitcoin support. 
- We tweeted [@privateum](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1663859816270376961) about this potential bug.

**Update: 2023-11-02** To date, the provider has not responded. We tested the app again and all that is available are Binance Chain tokens. This app does not support the Bitcoin protocol.
