## Google Play Review

  ★☆☆☆☆ January 27, 2023 <br>
       Your sending fees are extremely too high. Where on earth can someone send a btc worthy $21 and charged $11.50 for such a transaction? This is clear daylight robbery. I give you 0.00000006% of a star.

## Verdict 

As the provider mentions, the service is a **custodial** service. Once we've downloaded and registered with the platform, we were able to see options for depositing or withdrawing BTC. However, we were not able to find the seed phrases or the private keys. This app **cannot be verified**.
