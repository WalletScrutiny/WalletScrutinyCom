The Google Play description certainly sounds like a custodial wallet:

> Abra is the worldâ€™s first global investment app that enables you to invest in
hundreds of cryptocurrencies* like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Litecoin, Stellar,
Monero, and many more all in one app.

As we can't find a word on security or their source code or about the user being
in control we conclude for now this is a custodial app which gives it our
verdict: **not verifiable**.
