## Analysis 

- When we installed the app on Blue Stacks 5 Pie, the app showed the splash logo and then a [big 404](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1656604248698912772). 
- The website associated with this app ayrextrading.com seems to be focusing or pivoting on other affiliated services notably: Crypto Mining Farms and Hosting. 
- We sent an email to the listed email address over at info@ayrextrading.com. 
- The former meta-verdict of obsolete may be transitioning to **defunct**, but we'll let the provider give feedback since their website is still in operation.
