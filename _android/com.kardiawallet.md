The KardiaChain wallet is specifically for use with the KAI token. 

From its [documentation](https://docs.kardiachain.io/docs/)

>KardiaChain is an accessible blockchain for millions and is a decentralized public blockchain which provides the dual Master node to facilitate inter-chain operations among both existing and upcoming blockchain platforms

We downloaded the app and verified that it **does not have a bitcoin wallet**.
