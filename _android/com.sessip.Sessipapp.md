## App Analysis 

It was difficult to analyze this app since we cannot register (we keep getting a [404 error](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1624002513543520256)). Documentation info was also difficult to come by because of many reasons. The language is in French, and though it can be auto-translated via Google Translate, the links sometimes led to a different domain (ibitas.com) and sometimes to blank pages.

We were able to find a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/76NGlVurBz4?t=153) showing the app's features by some random user. 

Luckily, the twitter account responded and we promptly asked if the app provides the private keys of the user. 

We also emailed them: 

> Salut,
>
> Nous avons quelques questions sur l'application Bitcoin Sessip. Nous aimerions savoir si votre application a la fonction de sauvegarder la clé privée ou les "phrases de départ".
>
> Merci.

Until such time the provider responds to our question, we see that most indications are this is a **custodial service**.
