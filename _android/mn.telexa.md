## App Description from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mn.telexa) 

Translated from Russian using Google Translate.

> Telexa.mn is Mongolia's first automated investment platform. You just set how often and how much money you want to invest in which types of coins and stocks, and it will automatically invest on your behalf.

### The [FAQ](https://www.telexa.mn/) 

We had difficulty registering with this service since the interface is primarily in Russian. 

We contacted support to ask if their app supports BTC deposits/withdrawals and await their response. 

## Analysis 

We downloaded the app and registered. [(Screenshots)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1648588977895768064)

As far as we can tell, the app did not have a Bitcoin wallet. We had to translate each page of the app, and the input only accepted Mongolian characters. We were not able to find anything that resembles a send/receive function, nor a logo of Bitcoin attached to what we normally see in apps that has this functionality.  

As [@Giszmo](https://gitlab.com/Giszmo) pointed out [here](https://gitlab.com/walletscrutiny/walletScrutinyCom/-/merge_requests/417#note_1357965806), the app seems to be geared towards other investment products.
