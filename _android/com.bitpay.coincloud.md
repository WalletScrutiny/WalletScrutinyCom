It is very clear that the provider is claiming that this wallet is non-custodial with this early statement found in the [play store description](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitpay.coincloud).

> Keep your bitcoin and other digital currency secure and under your own control with the non-custodial Coin Cloud Wallet app.

With keys in control of the user, we need to find the source code in order to check reproducibility. However we are unable to locate a public source repository.

Our verdict: As there is no source code to be found anywhere, this wallet is at best a non-custodial closed source wallet and as such **not verifiable**.
