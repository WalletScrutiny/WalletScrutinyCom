## App and Company History

- Today the url coin.cloud/app redirects to a different domain [(bitstop.co)](https://bitstop.co/), with different apps:
  - {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/co.hodlwallet' verdict='true' %}
  - {% include walletLink.html wallet='iphone/co.hodlwallet' verdict='true' %}

- Genesis Coin, Inc. [was acquired](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/worlds-largest-bitcoin-atm-software-platform-acquired-by-bitstop-founders) by BitStop founders, January 2023
- Coin Cloud has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last February 2023
- Coin Cloud was [acquired](https://www.atmmarketplace.com/news/genesis-coin-to-add-more-than-5700-crypto-atms-from-coincloud/) by Genesis Coin in July 2023

We didn't dig further as to why the dates don't line up. Our guess is it has something to do with paperwork and filings that do not coincide with the press releases. But ultimately, BitStop became the surviving monolithic entity - hence, the reason for the redirection of the domains. 

## Why does Coin Cloud have so many apps? 

Bad versioning. We took a look at the history of the url "coin.cloud/app" and found that the app was different. 

**For [June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210616162825/https://coin.cloud/app) the linked apps were:**

- {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.bitpay.coincloud' verdict='true' %}
- {% include walletLink.html wallet='iphone/com.bitpay.coincloud' verdict='true' %}

**For [March 2023](https://web.archive.org/web/20230316190543/https://coin.cloud/app) the linked apps were:**

- {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.coincloud.walletpreview' verdict='true' %}
- {% include walletLink.html wallet='iphone/com.coincloud.walletpreview' verdict='true' %}

## Main Review

It is very clear that the provider is claiming that this wallet is non-custodial with this early statement found in the [play store description](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitpay.coincloud).

> Keep your bitcoin and other digital currency secure and under your own control with the non-custodial Coin Cloud Wallet app.

With keys in control of the user, we need to find the source code in order to check reproducibility. However we are unable to locate a public source repository.

Our verdict: As there is no source code to be found anywhere, this wallet is at best a non-custodial closed source wallet and as such **not verifiable**.
