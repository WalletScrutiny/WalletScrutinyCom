This wallet - `com.crypto.multiwallet` according to their applicationId,
"Moxi wallet" according to the first sentence of their description on Google
Play and "Guarda Wallet – for Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc." according to the app name -


doesn't have access to your private keys ...

> Moxi wallet doesn't have access to your keys and does not store your funds,

or do they? Here is the next sentence from the Google Play description:

> they are stored offline. We provide a wallet's backup for extra safety.

That sounds a lot like the provider keeps a copy of your private keys, does it
not?

Yet under features they explicitly claim:

> – Non-custodial wallet. We do not store your money.

Also good to know:

> This app does not mine cryptocurrency.

So maybe the confusion above is just a language barrier thing. We will assume
for now that the wallet is in fact non-custodial and the backup scheme actually
does work without them having access. In a deeper review, this would certainly
be one of the first points to check.

Looking for source code, we found a link to the company GitHub and from there to
a repository named
[guarda-android-wallets](https://github.com/guardaco/guarda-android-wallets) -
very promising.

As it turns out, "guarda-android-wallets" can be used to compile single coin
wallets but no app with the application ID `com.crypto.multiwallet`. In fact a
[search over all of GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=%22com.crypto.multiwallet%22)
didn't yield results neither.

Without source code available, our verdict is: **not verifiable**.
