## Updated Review 2021-10-29

### Contact

The last time we made this review, the 'BTC Wallet' tab was not functional from the web interface. It is now working. 

We were able to access [Send and Receive functions](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1454004670360272896/photo/1). There is also a QR code. Since our web app and the Android app's BTC address was the same, we assume that the service is synchronizing the details for this wallet. 

We now believe this service to be a **custodial** service. The app **cannot be verified**.


## Old Review 2021-10-19

## App Description

The app is a Nigerian-based app that allows users to convert gift cards such as _"Amazon, Google Play, iTunes gift card, eBay, Sephora, Nordstrom, Target, Apple store, Vanilla gift card, Visa gift card, Roblox gift card, OffGamers gift card, Google Play gift card or AMEX gift card"_ to cash.

It is also possible to sell Bitcoin for Naira using the app. 

This app is very similar to the following apps:

{% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.prestmit' verdict='true' %}
{% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.truthx.truthx' verdict='true' %}

Like the above-mentioned apps

       Tried to cash out and was told the transaction was suspended. No details on where to go from there and it is still suspended several days later.

## The Site

Sign up can be done via app or via their web portal. User-logins and passwords are synchronized.

We could not find their terms and conditions - clicking on the Terms and Conditions link during registration, does not elicit any response and does not open a link.

There is a tab for 'BTC Wallet' but after we clicked on it, the page displayed a **server 500** error. We asked GCBuying both on [twitter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1448544667956514829) and on their online chat support and await their response.

There is also a tab for Sell Bitcoin with the following fields:

- Total amount in USD
- Total amount in BTC
- You Will Get (N) 
- Please Pay to (BTC Address)
- Upload Your Transaction Image

Once you fill up 'Total amount in USD', the other fields are filled up with their respective conversion rates. The user is then expected to send an amount in BTC to the indicated BTC address. This is verified by uploading an image of the transaction.

Withdrawal is denominated in Naira. 

You are also expected to input:

- Bank Name
- Account Name 
- Bank Account No

## Contact

They've responded to our web-chat query:

> Hello<br>
BTC wallet Server 500<br>
Do not use your BTC wallet sir<br>
We are working on it<br>
Broken? Okay.

<hr>

## Verdict

**Word of Caution:** Although there is a lot of positive reviews on Google Play, there is also a growing number of critical reviews. We strongly advise users to do more in-depth due-diligence when they transact with this service. 

As noted above, there is a 'BTC Wallet' tab, which the user can click, however clicking it, returns a **Server 500 error**. Even if the app did have a BTC wallet in it, without proof such as tutorials or how-to "deposit/withdraw" bitcoin, we can only go by the evidence that shows that this app **does not have a BTC wallet**. With that said, we are willing to change this verdict if new information arises.
