This appears to not be a wallet as to our understanding, it does not hold any
private keys but delegates that part to {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/it.airgap.vault' %}
without which it does not work.

> **AirGap Vault**, the private key is generated and securely stored in the
  AirGap Vault app. **You have to install AirGap Vault to use AirGap Wallet**
