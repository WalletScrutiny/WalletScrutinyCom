## Analysis 

This cryptocurrency exchange:

> All assets are 100% stored in cold wallets. Each withdrawal is thoroughly monitored on the blockchain and requires two-person approval with offline signatures. With the executive team's advanced Wall Street risk management experience, malicious actions are easily detected and protective measures are quickly deployed.

Enough to lead us to a **custodial** verdict.
