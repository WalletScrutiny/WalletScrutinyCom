## Analysis 

We were not able to get the verification in order to register. 

The website displays a custom error that it would be back online on February 1, 2023. That date has passed. It also states that the site should be online now. 

> System is under maintenance until 02/01/2023, please wait. We apologize for the inconvenience.
Maintenance completed

As a cryptocurrency exchange it is very likely that this is a custodial exchange. 

We cannot add the iOS app as the app's page does not load. It may have been removed. 

We were able to access a subdomain related to the provider.

The last maintenance update was dated July 4, 2022.

The last telegram update also features users complaining about the app not starting - after their concluded airdrop. 

Though most of these proofs do not concretely substantiate a **custodial** verdict, it is very likely that it is.

In Telegram, the last message dated February 21, 2023 reads: 

> Your assets will still be safe and absolutely secure. The assets you have deposited before will still be paid interest as usual.
