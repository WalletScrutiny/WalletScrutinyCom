## Analysis

- We installed the app and it supports a Bech32 BTC wallet that can send and receive.
- The seed phrases were provided during startup.
- There are no claims that the project is source-available. A code search on GitHub [does not yield any results](https://github.com/search?q=com.ancryptoWallet&type=code).
- This app is **not source-available**.
