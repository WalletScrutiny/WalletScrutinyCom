## Update 2024-07-15

An [announcement](https://shapeshift.com/newsroom/shapeshift-releases-new-and-improved-mobile-app-and-migrates-legacy-users) was made on October 19, 2022 regarding ShapeShift's app:

> “In addition to the numerous improvements and new features, the new mobile app is fully open-source and the only backend is blockchain data一which we are actively working to decentralize with FOXChain. ShapeShift DAO is dedicated to building the best interface to the decentralized universe, and with new wallets, chains, and protocols being added each week, the vision is coming together. However, for this vision to fully come to fruition, the interface can’t just exist on the web; it must be available on mobile too.” - Willy Ogorzaly

- We confirmed the app has a Bitcoin wallet that can send/receive.
- It provided the 12-word seed phrases
- We confirmed the existence of its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/shapeshift/mobile-app) for the mobile app.
- This app is due **for verification**.

## Review 2021-05-23

ShapeShift is best known for their non-custodial exchange but this app appears
to be a wallet:

> **STORE YOUR CRYPTO IN A SECURE WALLET**<br>
  Setup a ShapeShift multi-chain wallet in seconds to store your crypto.

... and non-custodial:

> ShapeShift makes self-custody easy, never holding your coins, so you have
  complete control over your assets.

but is their code public? 

On the [referenced website](https://shapeshift.com/) there is no link back to
the app on App Store or Play Store but there is
[this site](https://shapeshift.com/invite) where they suggest having an
invite-only mobile app. When you provide them with your email (Seriously?) they ...
forward you to [this site](https://shapeshift.com/download) where there are
actually download links for both mobile apps.

As we couldn't find any source code we assume the app is closed source and
therefore **not verifiable**.
