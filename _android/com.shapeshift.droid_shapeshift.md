## Split APK Semi-Auto Builds 2024-08-09  

We started with creating a Dockerfile that can build multiple artifacts. We began by extracting the official apks from our phone by executing our [apkextractor_sync.sh](https://gitlab.com/walletscrutiny/walletScrutinyCom/-/blob/master/apkextractor_sync.sh?ref_type=heads) script. 

We upload this manually to the server.

Still in our manual build folder, we create a `com.shapeshift.droid_shapeshift.sh` script and its partner `Dockerfile`

### App specific script that builds the split apks

`com.shapeshift.droid_shapeshift.sh`:

  ```
  #!/bin/bash

  # Set script to exit on any error
  set -e

  # Define directories
  SCRIPT_DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" &> /dev/null && pwd )"
  SPLITS_DIR="${SCRIPT_DIR}/fromBuildSplits"
  UNZIPPED_DIR="${SCRIPT_DIR}/unzipped-fromBuildSplits"
  OFFICIAL_APKS_DIR="/var/shared/apk/com.shapeshift.droid_shapeshift/328-splits/official"
  OFFICIAL_NORMALIZED_DIR="/tmp/shapeshift-build/fromOfficial"
  BUILD_NORMALIZED_DIR="/tmp/shapeshift-build/fromBuild"

  # Ensure required directories exist
  mkdir -p "${SPLITS_DIR}"
  mkdir -p "${UNZIPPED_DIR}"
  mkdir -p "${OFFICIAL_NORMALIZED_DIR}"
  mkdir -p "${OFFICIAL_NORMALIZED_DIR}/apks"
  mkdir -p "${BUILD_NORMALIZED_DIR}"

  # Build Docker image with no cache
  echo "Building Docker image..."
  docker build --no-cache -t shapeshift-build .

  # Check if container already exists and remove it
  if [ "$(docker ps -aq -f name=shapeshift-container)" ]; then
      echo "Removing existing container..."
      docker rm -f shapeshift-container
  fi

  # Run Docker container
  echo "Running Docker container..."
  docker run -d --name shapeshift-container shapeshift-build tail -f /dev/null

  # Copy artifacts from container
  echo "Copying artifacts from container..."
  docker cp shapeshift-container:/app/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/splits "${SPLITS_DIR}"

  # Stop and remove the container
  docker stop shapeshift-container
  docker rm shapeshift-container

  # Process split APKs from the container
  echo "Processing split APKs from the build..."
  cd "${SPLITS_DIR}/splits"
  for apk in base-*.apk; do
      if [[ -f "$apk" ]]; then
          # Extract name without 'base-' prefix and '.apk' suffix
          name=$(echo "$apk" | sed 's/^base-//; s/\.apk$//')
          
          # Normalize name
          case "$name" in

          mkdir -p "${BUILD_NORMALIZED_DIR}/${folder}"
          unzip -q "$apk" -d "${BUILD_NORMALIZED_DIR}/${folder}"
          echo "Unzipped $apk to ${folder}/"
      fi
  done

  # Copy official APKs and normalize their names
  echo "Copying and normalizing official APKs..."
  cd "${OFFICIAL_APKS_DIR}"
  for apk in base.apk split_config.*.apk; do
      if [[ -f "$apk" ]]; then
          # Normalize name
          name=$(echo "$apk" | sed 's/^split_config\.//; s/\.apk$//')
          folder="${name}"
          
          # Create folder and unzip
          mkdir -p "${OFFICIAL_NORMALIZED_DIR}/${folder}"
          unzip -q "$apk" -d "${OFFICIAL_NORMALIZED_DIR}/${folder}"
          echo "Unzipped $apk to ${folder}/"

          # Move APK to 'apks' folder
          mv "$apk" "${OFFICIAL_NORMALIZED_DIR}/apks/${name}.apk"
      fi
  done

  # Echo a message that diff is now being run
  echo -e "\e[96mRunning diff...\e[0m"

  # Run diff for like vs like folders
  for folder in armeabi_v7a en base xhdpi; do
      if [ -d "${OFFICIAL_NORMALIZED_DIR}/${folder}" ] && [ -d "${BUILD_NORMALIZED_DIR}/${folder}" ]; then
          echo "Comparing ${folder}..."
          diff -r "${OFFICIAL_NORMALIZED_DIR}/${folder}/" "${BUILD_NORMALIZED_DIR}/${folder}/"
      fi
  done

  echo "Comparison complete!"
  ```

{% include asciicast %}

After a successful build, we document the steps we've undertaken and publish an interim merge request. During the initial stages of our analysis, we try to reach out to the developers and inform them of our methodology and the resulting diffs. Differences in build variables, environment or some other cause, may result in a huge diff. For this reason, we filed a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/shapeshift/mobile-app/issues/104) in their repository. If developer outreach is successful, we can collaborate with the goal in making the build reproducible. 

We previously built from a single apk yesterday where the diffs were quite extensive. Our findings remain consistent when we built the split apks and ran a diff against the normalized and unzipped artifacts.

With the diffs across all split apks, that go beyond signing, version 3.1.0 of Shapeshift Android app is **non-verifiable**. 

## Update 2024-07-15

An [announcement](https://shapeshift.com/newsroom/shapeshift-releases-new-and-improved-mobile-app-and-migrates-legacy-users) was made on October 19, 2022 regarding ShapeShift's app:

> “In addition to the numerous improvements and new features, the new mobile app is fully open-source and the only backend is blockchain data一which we are actively working to decentralize with FOXChain. ShapeShift DAO is dedicated to building the best interface to the decentralized universe, and with new wallets, chains, and protocols being added each week, the vision is coming together. However, for this vision to fully come to fruition, the interface can’t just exist on the web; it must be available on mobile too.” - Willy Ogorzaly

- We confirmed the app has a Bitcoin wallet that can send/receive.
- It provided the 12-word seed phrases
- We confirmed the existence of its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/shapeshift/mobile-app) for the mobile app.
- This app is due **for verification**.

## Review 2021-05-23

ShapeShift is best known for their non-custodial exchange but this app appears
to be a wallet:

> **STORE YOUR CRYPTO IN A SECURE WALLET**<br>
  Setup a ShapeShift multi-chain wallet in seconds to store your crypto.

... and non-custodial:

> ShapeShift makes self-custody easy, never holding your coins, so you have
  complete control over your assets.

but is their code public? 

On the [referenced website](https://shapeshift.com/) there is no link back to
the app on App Store or Play Store but there is
[this site](https://shapeshift.com/invite) where they suggest having an
invite-only mobile app. When you provide them with your email (Seriously?) they ...
forward you to [this site](https://shapeshift.com/download) where there are
actually download links for both mobile apps.

As we couldn't find any source code we assume the app is closed source and
therefore **not verifiable**.
