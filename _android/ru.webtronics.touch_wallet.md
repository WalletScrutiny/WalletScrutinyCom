       Why is this app misbehaving, downloaded it two times but yet the same thing ðŸ˜”, it is the same network am using in others but it is tell me no network, gosh ðŸ˜ž

## Analysis

- The app has a rating of 2.0 stars given by 53 reviewers. The actual reviews are hidden.
- After registration, the email address is verified.
- Logging in brings us to the main page. The bottom tab menu includes:
  - Main
  - Balance
  - NFT
  - Menu
- Clicking on BTC, opens a wallet page with the following options:
  - Top up Balance
  - Withdraw Funds 
  - Exchange
  - Settings
  - Buy
- The app provides a Bech32 BTC address for receiving Bitcoin.
- There is also a withdrawal option.
- There is no backup mechanism for the private keys. We find this concerning since the provider states that they do not store the private keys in the Terms.
- We find it irregular that the Terms can only be read from the app during registration and cannot be copy-pasted. We could not find a copy of the Terms on their website.
- Even though it is stated in the Terms that the provider does not control the private keys, they have also not provided a way to extract this using the app. Without the private keys, the only assumption we can make is that they do control it after all, thus making this service **custodial**.
