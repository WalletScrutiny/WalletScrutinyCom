## Analysis 

- The app has similarities with {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.binance.dev' verdict='true' %} and is a cryptocurrency exchange.
- We registered by verifying our email address and found a legacy BTC deposit address. Deposit and withdrawals are available.
- Users can also transfer between a "spot" and "futures" account
- We were not given the seed phrase during sign-up and found no options to back up the private keys. 
- This makes it a **custodial** provider with a **non-verifiable** app.
