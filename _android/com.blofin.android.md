## Analysis 

We installed the app and found that we could only withdraw or deposit USDT. However, since this is an exchange where it is possible to buy BTC/USDT, we are assuming that it is possible to 'hold bitcoin' in this custodial service. But cannot send and receive it, as it has to be converted back to USDT.
