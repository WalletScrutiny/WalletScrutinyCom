## Analysis

- [Video of fiat withdrawal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr2a6tcPvkQ) to Nigerian banks is possible.
- [Video of fiat deposit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEPXyaDYHvA) to Mara Wallet using bank transfer.

- The app has a termination clause in its [Terms and Conditions](https://mara.xyz/terms)
- First, we registered our email address. Registration asked for: DOB, full name, country and phone number.
- We then created a pin.
- We were asked to verify our identity but opted to skip.
- The main interface gave us a referral code and an interface to track our referrals. We clicked on the 'Portfolio' option, but it gave an error:
  > Portfolio Locked. We're unable to offer this feature in your country of residence at the moment. We'll notify you as soon as we're able to.
- We tried changing our country of residence to Nigeria, but it only gave a different prompt: "Verify your Identity"
- We will assume that their claims of supporting Bitcoin with buy, sell, swap, send and withdraw functions are true. Documentation is also sparse about its support for cryptocurrency.
- Without access to the app's main functions, we'll have to base our judgment on their claims and on some of their [promotional videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5YoFZU_HKo).
- We asked them on [twitter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1677852954076889089) and telegram about the availability of information concerning the Bitcoin wallet on their app.
- The app does not make any claims about source-availability and non-custody.
- While we wait for more information, we'll mark this app as **custodial** due to:
  - Its claims to support BTC.
  - The lack of information regarding private key backups.
  - Our inability to access even basic features of such a wallet until KYC is complete.
