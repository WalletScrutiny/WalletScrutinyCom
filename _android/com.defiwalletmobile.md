## Analysis

- The first action the app needed us to take was to accept the User Agreement
- We were then asked to provide a 4-digit pin code.
- The app then generated a 12-word mnemonic
- The app generated a legacy BTC address that can send and receive.
- The providers did not claim the source was available but had a GitHub link to their organization.
- We were able to find a [repository](https://github.com/SlvLabs/slavi-wallet) for the app but it did not have releases/tags.
- This app is **for verification.**
