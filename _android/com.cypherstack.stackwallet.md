**Update 2024-09-11:**

**Review: Stack Wallet Build**

The build process for the Stack Wallet was attempted using the provided Dockerfile. However, the build failed due to an issue within the `build_app.sh` script. The script could not proceed, and the build was halted.

**Command Used:**
```
docker build -t stack_wallet -f stack.dockerfile .
```

**Error Noted:**
The following error was encountered during the execution of the `build_app.sh` script:
```
+ ./build_app.sh -a stack_wallet -p android -v 1.0.0 -b 1
/app/stack_wallet /app/stack_wallet/scripts
/app/stack_wallet/scripts
+ echo build_app.sh failed
+ exit 1
build_app.sh failed
```

The Docker build process successfully reached the point of invoking the `build_app.sh` script, but the script failed without providing further details.

**Conclusion**:
The Stack Wallet build was not successful due to the failure of the `build_app.sh` script. Further investigation into the script and its dependencies is required to complete the build process. The wallet is **not verifiable** at this time.
