This app replaces the {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/io.natiol' verdict='true' %} app.

## App Description

The app description describes the Natiol corporate entity. It is primarily related to DeFi and staking. 

## Analysis 

We installed the app and we signed up. Our login credentials are reflected on the web platform. 

We were not given a seed phrase and we could not find a BTC wallet. There is an option to "stake BTC" but we do not see an address. When we try to open the app settings, the app automatically closes. 

We do **not see a Bitcoin wallet** in this app.
