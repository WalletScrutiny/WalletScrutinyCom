## Analysis

- We registered and verified our email.
- We found a BTC deposit option and the app generated a P2SH address.
- The bottom panel options were:
  - Home
  - Swapping
  - Earn
  - Wallet
  - Account
    - Dark mode
    - Security
      - 2FA
    - Change Password
    - Report a problem
    - Logout
- Curiously, we were not able to find any option to backup the private keys as most DeFi apps do.
- The platform also has [KYC protocols](https://defiato.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/900000589326-KYC-Verification) in place.
- We also signed-in on the web platform using the same credentials and was successful.
- New users are given a user tier of VIP-0.
- A further search provided us with an insight to DeFiato's service: [DeFiato provides "institutional grade custody"](https://media.defiato.com/blog/meet-defiato-next-gen-defi-platform/).
- All evidence point to a **custodial** platform.
