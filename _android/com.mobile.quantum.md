## Analysis

- We registered successfully in the app. 
- There was a BTC wallet with send/receive functions. 
- Were not able to find any option to backup/restore the private keys.
- The app has user-tiers that are upgradeable by verifying the user's identity. 
- The platform is account-based with no indications of self-custodial features. Therefore, this is a **custodial** service.
