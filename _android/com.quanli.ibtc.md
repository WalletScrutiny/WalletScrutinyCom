## Analysis 

Registration would only accept Hong Kong or Chinese numbers. The interface was primarily in Chinese. 

> IBTC reserves the right to reject or cancel Orders made and/or pending during downtime. Certain deposit or withdrawal requests for both Digital Assets and fiat currencies may not be processed outside of normal banking hours. Orders may be subject to delays, difficulties, and/or conditions affecting transmission or execution of Orders over which IBTC has no control, including but not limited to, mechanical or electronic failure or market congestion.

Without being able to register we glean some facts from the terms. 

- The platform exercises a certain level of control over deposits and withdrawals. 
- The transaction fees regarding Bitcoin indicate that the platform can send and receive Bitcoin. 

As such, this is a **custodial** platform.
