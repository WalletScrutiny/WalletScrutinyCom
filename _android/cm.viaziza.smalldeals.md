## Contact 

They replied via email:

> Thank you for showing interest in our app. Indeed, our application is a marketplace that makes contact so merchants register and put their product. fill in their accepted means of payment. Of course we are crypto freindly. So in the current version payments are not made on the application. In the version under development, we therefore include the order tunnel so that users can pay directly on the web application and also on mobile. We will use existing crypto payment processors and integrate them as means of payment.
> So we don't provide BITCOIN wallet and wish to know how to do it in another future project.

## Analysis 

We were not able to find a Bitcoin wallet or any wallet on the app.
