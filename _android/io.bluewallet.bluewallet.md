**Update 2023-06-21**:
Recent release (v6.4.5) of this wallet with the apk downloaded from Github 
is also **reproducible**:

v6.4.5
===== End Results =====
```

But the Play Store version still has some diffs mentioned in [this github issue](https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet/issues/758).

**Update 2023-05-21**:
Emanuel from WalletScrutiny was able to reproduce the apk (v6.3.2) downloaded from github.
In [this github issue](https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet/issues/758) he showed
that the diff comes from ordering of lines in `AndroidManifest.xml`. By setting a static value 
for `com.bugsnag.android.BUILD_UUID` the apk from github was reproducible.
So I (Mohammad) updated the test script of WalletScrutiny based on the Emanuel's 
approach and tried it with v6.4.4 and it was **reproducible**.
However, test results for the apk downloaded from Play Store indicates that there 
is a diff in `AndroidManifest.xml` file, a meta-data tag,
`<meta-data android:name="com.android.vending.derived.apk.id" android:value="1"/>`
which is generated by Play Store signing procedure. For more info refer to 
[this thread](https://gitlab.com/walletscrutiny/walletScrutinyCom/-/issues/430).
After adding this line manually, the test passed successfully. Here are the test results:

As [announced on Feb 23, 2023](https://bluewallet.io/sunsetting-lndhub/), the
default custodial LN backend for {{ page.title }} is being discontinued. We tried it
out and as of today, creating a default LN account stopped working if the user
does not provide some backend URL. This resolves a
[long-standing issue](https://gitlab.com/walletscrutiny/walletScrutinyCom/-/issues/117)
that had
us list this product as "custodial" as a whole. As {{ page.title }} now is in
its entirety self-custodial (unless the user takes deliberate action to
configure a third party custodian), we have to look deeper into this popular and
feature-rich product.

The product has [public source code](https://github.com/bluewallet/bluewallet),
the latest version on Play Store - 6.3.2 - is also the
[latest release on GitHub](https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet/releases).

So, let's see if we can compile it ...

[The Readme](https://github.com/bluewallet/bluewallet) does not describe how to
locally build a release APK. Only how to install a developer version on a
connected device. In
[RELEASE.md](https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet/blob/master/RELEASE.md),
the process is described though, right? The document mainly focuses on bumping
app version, release message and testing the release before pushing it to all
users. The one line about actually building the release would be:

> * go to appcenter.ms, find this exact build under `master` builds, and press `Distribute` -> `Store` -> `Production`.

[AppCenter](https://appcenter.ms/) is a Microsoft tool to

> Continuously build, test, release, and monitor apps for every platform.

which means we have to figure out how Microsoft builds their product as the
provider doesn't build or doesn't share that configuration.

... actually, there is
[this old issue of ours](https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet/issues/758)
where we had tried many times to reproduce this product years ago. `/scripts`
folder they said?


```
$ git clone https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet
$ cd BlueWallet/
$ cat scripts/build-release-apk.sh 
#!/bin/bash


# assumes 2 env variables: KEYSTORE_FILE_HEX & KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
#
# PS. to turn file to hex and back:
#     $ xxd -plain test.txt > test.hex
#     $ xxd -plain -revert test.hex test2.txt


echo $KEYSTORE_FILE_HEX > bluewallet-release-key.keystore.hex
xxd -plain -revert bluewallet-release-key.keystore.hex > ./android/bluewallet-release-key.keystore
rm bluewallet-release-key.keystore.hex

cd android
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%s)
sed -i'.original'  "s/versionCode 1/versionCode $TIMESTAMP/g" app/build.gradle
./gradlew assembleRelease
mv ./app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk ./app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
$ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/30.0.2/apksigner sign --ks ./bluewallet-release-key.keystore   --ks-pass=pass:$KEYSTORE_PASSWORD ./app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
``` 

requires a keystore and introduces randomnes in the result, which would break
reproducibility. The latter is also referenced in
[this open issue](https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet/issues/3148) so in
the best case we expect to find this product miss the goal of reproducibility
by only a timestamp. Let's see ...

```

```

... which is apparently a regression as
[this issue about ssh dependencies](https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet/issues/3059)
was closed as fixed two years ago.

We file this product as **not verifiable** for now and hope the provider
resolves all the relevant issues for a re-evaluation:

* https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet/issues/3148
