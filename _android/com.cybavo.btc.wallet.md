- For full access, contact us at wallet-support@cybavo.com
- We emailed them. 

## Analysis 

- Sign up is only available through the following:
  - Google 
  - Line 
  - Facebook 
  - Twitter 
- We tried signing up via Google, and it gave an error: 

> (134) User unauthorized. 

- We tried signing up via Twitter, but it issued an error: 

> Unable to complete action

- Cybavo is reportedly a Circle company, so we'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assign a verdict when they have responded to our email. We'll keep this as a work-in-progress for the meantime.
