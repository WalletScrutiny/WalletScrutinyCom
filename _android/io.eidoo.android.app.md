Version 2 was [announced](https://helpdesk.eidoo.io/hc/en-us/articles/7886897307025-Eidoo-v2-announcement) on Eidoo's helpdesk page. There, v1 is considered obsolete. 

Eidoo's homepage is currently inaccessible because of an SSL misconfiguration. Based on the announcements in the official Twitter account and the helpdesk documents, the version 2 and version 1 apps are indeed, related.

## Analysis

- The first option with the app was to create a wallet. It opened a new screen where we agreed to the T&C of Eidoo App, Eidoo Finance, Eidoo ID and an agreement to transfer my existing Eidoo ID data to the new providers as per the T&Cs and Privacy Policy. We accepted all 4.
- A notice popped up regarding the EidooCARD program powered by Contis. They ceased offering it on January 25, 2023.
- We were then shown a multicurrency wallet with BTC.
- We were asked to create a password after we tapped BTC.
- A 12-word mnemonic was then provided.
- We searched on GitHub Code for the app ID, but found [0 results](https://github.com/search?q=io.eidoo.android.app&type=code)
- The provider also did not make any claims regarding source-availability.
- This app is **not source-available**.
