## Analysis

- The first option with the app was to create a wallet. It opened a new screen where we agreed to the T&C of Eidoo App, Eidoo Finance, Eidoo ID and an agreement to transfer my existing Eidoo ID data to the new providers as per the T&Cs and Privacy Policy. We accepted all 4.
- A notice popped up regarding the EidooCARD program powered by Contis. They ceased offering it on January 25, 2023.
- We were then shown a multicurrency wallet with BTC.
- We were asked to create a password after we tapped BTC.
- A 12-word mnemonic was then provided.
- We searched on GitHub Code for the app ID, but found [0 results](https://github.com/search?q=io.eidoo.android.app&type=code)
- The provider also did not make any claims regarding source-availability.
- This app is **not source-available**.
