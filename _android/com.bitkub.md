> Bitkub is a new generation digital asset and cryptocurrency exchange platform

This sounds like an exchange.

> We require pin code protection and other security measures such as biometric and fingerprint scan.

Identity verification is almost always a trait of custodial products.

While this is a trading platform it is still possible to send and receive BTC. With this info, we can assume this is **custodial** and **not verifiable.**
