## Analysis 

- Section 2.3 of the [terms](https://www.cointree.com/company/terms-of-service/) describes the user creating an account wherein CoinTree holds the coins on behalf of the user in cold and hot wallets. 

This explicitly tells us that this is a **custodial** service with a **non-verifiable** app.
