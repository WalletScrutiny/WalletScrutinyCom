       It's a Scam, you can deposit Money but can't withdraw money, they will show always withdraw is on pending. Also they won't respond properly over whatsapp or email Edit: and finally they blocked my Coincred account and didn't refunded my money. Even they don't reply on whatsapp, before I deposited money they used to reply instant on whatsapp support. Edit : Finally my account activated back and withdraw is successful after 12 days. Increased rate from 1 to 3 star only because of poor service..

       After a month's time and frustration, they finally made the transactions work. I had given up thinking my 1000₹ is gone. The initial customer support was absolutely pathetic, they would never pick up calls, or cut calls abruptly. Today the person who handled the issue was great, fast and efficient. Hopefully they continue it this way. Trading is fast on this app but needs more transparency such as deleting account or viewing details.
