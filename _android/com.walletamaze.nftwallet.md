## Analysis

- After signing up for an account we proceeded to create a wallet.
- The seed phrases were provided. The app stopped working right after we confirmed the phrases. The app just closed and would not open again. This was in BlueStacks 5 Android 9.
- The iphone version is still on testflight.
- We tried again on a mobile device and were successfully able to import the seed phrases.
- We were able to generate a BTC wallet with a Bech32 native SegWit address and prefix of bc1. It can send and receive.
- There are no overt statements saying the project is source-available.
- We did find an organizational account on GitHub: [AmazeWallet](https://github.com/WeAreAmaze/amazewallet)
- However, searching for the app Id of {{ page.title }}, [did not yield any results](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AWeAreAmaze%20com.walletamaze.nftwallet&type=code). It appears the GitHub account is merely a placeholder.
- The app is **not source-available**.
