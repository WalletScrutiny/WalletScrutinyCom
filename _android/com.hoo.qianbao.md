The app store page did not directly link to any website. However, the email listed in that page uses hoo.com as a domain name.

## The App
We tried the app and registered a new user account. The private keys were not provided. 

It is possible to withdraw and deposit from your balance, but users must set a transaction password first. The app in itself has the interface of an exchange app.

## Verdict
We mark this app as **custodial** and thus **not verifiable.**
