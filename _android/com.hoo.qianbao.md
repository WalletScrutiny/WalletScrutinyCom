The app store page did not directly link to any website. However, the email listed in that page uses hoo.com as a domain name.

>  If the user violates the above provisions, **Hoo has the right to take all necessary measures directly, including but not limited to deleting the content posted by the user, canceling the stars and honors obtained by the user on the website, freezing the digital assets of the user**, suspending or sealing up the user account, canceling the benefits obtained due to the violation, and even investigating the legal liability of the user through litigation.

## The App
We tried the app and registered a new user account. The private keys were not provided. 

It is possible to withdraw and deposit from your balance, but users must set a transaction password first. The app in itself has the interface of an exchange app.

## Verdict
We mark this app as **custodial** and thus **not verifiable.**
