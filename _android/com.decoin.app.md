## Analysis 

- The listed app's website has a 503 error 
- We tried to run the app on BlueStacks 5 Android Nougat, but the status circle just kept circling.
- The last accessible archive entry on archive.org was in [2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220110014511/https://www.decoin.io/en). 
- Upon account termination, the platform maintains *full custody* of the funds. This is characteristic of a **custodial** cryptocurrency exchange. But more powerful than that, is the fact that this service may already be **defunct**.
- We mailed decoin at the listed address: support@decoin.io, but our email was promptly returned.
