## Analysis 

- We signed up for the service and were able to find a Bech32 BTC address along with other accounts and currencies.
- We were not provided with the seed phrases. 
- Withdrawal is only possible after KYC verification.
- More information [about the wallet](https://zed-pay.com/blog/15):
  > Is ZedPay Wallet safe?
  >
  > Your ZedPay Wallet uses advanced encryption techniques to ensure your payment information is never stolen from your smartphone, and they are highly secure as they are usually used for fingerprint-only payments and reside on password-protected devices. Many wallets also have additional security protocols, such as two-factor authentication and one-time PINs, that can be used as needed.
- The [Terms](https://zed-pay.com/view/terms) is very sparse in the way of documentation. 
- We could not find any concrete indicator of the app providing the private keys to the user. We created a ticket via their web platform and asked this specific question. 
- Meanwhile, absent the private keys, we determine this app to be a **custodial** one that is **not verifiable**.
