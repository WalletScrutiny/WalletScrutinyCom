## Analysis 

- The app starts with an error:

> Set an unlock method
>
> To use the app you need to set up an unlock method, which is necessary for security reasons. 

- The website is currently offline 
- After some Googling, we found out that the company behind this app is undergoing judicial liquidation. [Source](https://www.boccadutri.com/bankruptcy-of-the-rock-trading-how-to-recover-lost-cryptocurrencies/)

> The judicial liquidation (a procedure that replaced bankruptcy) of The Rock Trading S.r.l., an Italian cryptocurrency exchange that allowed trading on cryptocurrencies, which ended up at the center of an investigation with allegations of fraud and embezzlement, to the detriment of thousands of customers, has been certified by a Milan court ruling dated 14/04/2023.

- As such, we can say that it is a **defunct** and **custodial** app, that has unfortunately, lost customer funds.
