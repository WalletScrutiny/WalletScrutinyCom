### Google Play

The app promises these features:

> **Main features:**
> - Collect coins for free.

> - Reliable exchange to exchange your coins.
> - Light payments by the faucets.
> - Faucets in Telegram totally reliable.
> - Reduction in advertising.

The developer ['Vessper'](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Vessper) also has another crypto-related app named "Claim Faucet Coins". 

### The Site

The app does not have a listed site. Nor a privacy policy. 

### The App

We downloaded the app and installed it on Blue-Stacks. The first thing we saw seems to be a splash ad for 'free bitcoins'. As we scrolled down, it seemed to include several thumbnails to other cryptocurrency sites. We then proceeded to find any wallet by clicking on the 'wallet' menu. 

It featured another page that had thumbnails of wallet providers such as coinbase, coinomi, bitpay, etc.

### Verdict

This app has **no wallet.**
