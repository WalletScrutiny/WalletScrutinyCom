**Update 2021-06-21**: This app is not a wallet.

> We are using Points as user balance to emphasize that Quicrypto is not a wallet or a monetary service provider. 

Verdict: This is not a wallet that holds bitcoins.

**Update 2021-04-25**: This app is not on Google Play anymore. It wasn't a
wallet anyway.

This app "pays" you in Bitcoin and Nano for tasks

> What is Quicrypto?
> 
> Quicrypto is a “reward app” that allows its users to earn money (in the form of the Nano cryptocurrency) by watching ads and completeing offers.

> What a scam.Unfortunatelly people still fall for it and the only reason it has
  a good rating is because they promise you a some coins for it.Do not download
  this useless virus app.

They also have instructions on how to get a wallet, so ... it's not a wallet
itself.
