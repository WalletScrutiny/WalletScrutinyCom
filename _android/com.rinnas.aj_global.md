## The App

We downloaded the app to test it. There is a bitcoin wallet that allows users to:

- Buy
- Sell
- Receive
- Transfer

### Buy

To buy bitcoin, the user must input a dollar value, which then calculates the Naira value and the Bitcoin value. You are then asked to fill up a 'Pin' field which is assigned by the user. Once an amount is inputted, there is a message that states:

> Note: Total bitcoin received by you may differ from the true value we sent.

### Sell

Selecting sell from the Bitcoin wallet, we are then presented with different 'Bitcoin variants':

- B1 - 10 to 99 ₦ 530
- B2 - 100 to 499 ₦ 540
- and so on

Selecting one presents us with a form that we are supposed to fill. Entering a dollar value calculates the Naira value and Bitcoin value. There's also a note that says:

> Note: Total credited amount may differ depending on the true value sent.

### Receive

It is possible to receive Bitcoin via QR code and a BTC wallet address

### Transfer

The fields for transfer are:

- Bitcoin Value
- Dollar Value
- Receiver Address
- Pin

### Gift Cards

This includes amazon, Google, iTunes, Steam and others.

## Verdict

Most apps with developers catering to the Nigerian population usually uses gift cards and Naira to trade Bitcoin. So far, among the other apps that we've reviewed, AJGlobal is one of the few that actually generates a BTC address with functions that allow sending or receiving. However, the service still holds the private keys, implements KYC and has a termination clause that could lock out the user from the platform. This makes the service **custodial** and the app **cannot be verified**.
