## App Description

The app describes itself as a "digital exchange" that services the Kenyan and Nigerian regions.

The Interest shall be subject to revision from time to time, at our sole and absolute discretion.

## The App

We tried the app and found a bitcoin wallet denominated in Naira and BTC. It has send, receive and transfer functions. What we found odd was the requirement of adding a bank before BTC could be sent. The transfer function is for transferring bitcoin to Koinwa community members. We were not able to find backup and restore functions. There was also no seed-phrases on the platform.

Buying Bitcoin gets credited on the app itself and not on a third party app.

## Verdict

Bitcoin loaning apps with a built-in wallet that needs to input a bank account are usually **custodial**. This means that the app **cannot be verified**.
