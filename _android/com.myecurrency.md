## Analysis 

We were not able to register as the app required a Nigerian phone number.

We could not find any indication in the [terms](https://myecurrencyng.com/terms-conditions-policies#terms-use), in the website or in the Google Play description itself whether the app provides a bitcoin wallet to its users. 

The only thing that's clear is the app allows the selling of bitcoin. Now this could be done by depositing or sending Bitcoin to a wallet controlled by the provider as is common with Nigerian-origin apps. Usually, users can withdraw fiat to their bank accounts after such a transaction. 

We contacted the provider via email and via web form to ask this question. 

Our interim verdict is this app **does not provide a wallet** for its users.
