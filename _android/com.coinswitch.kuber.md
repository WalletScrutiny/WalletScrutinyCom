  ★★★☆☆ October 17, 2021 <br>
       The line graphs showing the coin price over time is misleading. The price and the points on the graph doesn't corelate. I suspect they are running somekind of script to minimise out margine. Same coin showing different prices on the app's installed on two phones. If you purchase a coin and the price goes up, it will not go into gain untill the coin is 2-3 points up from buy price.
       
The reply being:

	Sorry if you feel that way. The price of a coin can be different from exchange to exchange. It is due to the available liquidity and demand of a coin in exchange. Kindly check the selling price of a coin before you buy/sell any coin so that you can have clarity on your earnings. Please know that invested prices are subjected to market value.
