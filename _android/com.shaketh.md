This app claims to be a wallet:

> Canadians buy and sell digital currencies in minutes with the Shakepay wallet.

In their [FAQ](https://help.shakepay.com/en/articles/1721007-what-happens-if-i-lose-my-phone)
they explain what you have to do if you lose your phone, once you have a new
phone:

> Weâ€™ll be able to update your Shakepay account's phone number and reset your
  2-Factor Authentication code.

That's all. If that's all, they must have the private keys which makes this app
a custodial service and thus **not verifiable**.
