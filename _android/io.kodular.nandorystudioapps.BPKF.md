There are multiple strange things about this app and the providers.

- There's no linked website. The Privacy Policy is a [Google Docs link.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g_KMwklCPIbUj9NpZ-xWYgW-67H2BaUfLpZj-LiB_ww/edit) Even the contents of the Privacy Policy are just copied from a template.
- The developer, ["Nandory Studio Apps"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=NandoryStudioApps) seems to have published other apps, but none of them are bitcoin related.

Here is one of the only reviews:

## Verdict

We conclude that this app **doesn't serve as a wallet** and there's nothing that suggests you can deposit money here.
