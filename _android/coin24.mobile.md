## Analysis 

- The homepage of this app is no longer online and this has been designated as obsolete. We will try to sign up, and if we fail, this means that the app is most likely **defunct**
- As expected, the app cannot be installed in our phone because it requires an old Android version, and the emulator only showed the splash logo and a [blank screen](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1648926465290018817) afterwards. 

This app is **defunct.**
