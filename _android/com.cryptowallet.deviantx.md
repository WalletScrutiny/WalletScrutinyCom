## Analysis 

- We tried installing the app on BlueStacks 5 Android Pie, BlueStacks 5 Android Nougat and on a virtual Pixel 4 API 29, and failed in all instances.
- When opening the app and it issued an error: 

> Something went wrong we are working over it. Please try after some time. 

- We were able to find the Deviant Core organizational GitHub page, but not the one corresponding to this specific app. 
- Since we were not able to test the app, we'll analyze it based on the description and available information on their website. We ascertained that: 

- The app supports Bitcoin 
- Provides for seed key storage for users
- However, its **source is not publicly-available**.
