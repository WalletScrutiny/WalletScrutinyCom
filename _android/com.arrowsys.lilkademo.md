## New Review 2021-10-29

## Contact

We contacted Lilka via their web-chat and took a [screenshot](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1453993651172904961) of the conversation. Marek, the support agent confirmed that the app:

> Its not bitcoin wallet, its mainly cash register that supports conversion of bitcoin through bitcoinpay so people can receive dollars etc 

## Additional information

From Lilka.cz

- Bitcoin directly to merchantâ€™s bitcoin wallet (third party wallet)
- Bitcoin payments converted to national currencies through Bitcoinpay.com

## Old Review 2021-10-04

## App Description

LILKA looks like and states that it is a Point of Sale. This makes it clear that this app is not primarily a bitcoin wallet or may not act as one.

In the description, it advertises the following features:

> BIP44, xpub and HD recipient addresses
> - Bitcoin and Litecoin payments support
> - Cryptocurrency exchange
> - Bitcoin price and transaction identifications on receipts
> - Direct conversion of bitcoin payments to national currencies via Bitcoinpay.com

Bitcoinpay.com redirects to a site called [confirmo.net](https://confirmo.net/).

From the website:

> Payout enables you to automatically send crypto payments directly from available EUR or USD balance. It only takes a few seconds to execute the Payout order. You don't have to worry about the security risks associated with holding crypto and their exchange rate volatility.

## The App

We downloaded the app and it seems to function as a normal PoS system. We couldn't find the option to send or receive bitcoin in the normal sense of a bitcoin wallet

The app only offers a demo license so we couldn't actually find the option to pay with bitcoin. But assuming the description and the website is accurate, this app doesn't allow users to send and receive bitcoin. It simply allows business owners to invoice customers with the option of paying with bitcoin.

## Verdict

We conclude that this app is **not a bitcoin wallet.**
