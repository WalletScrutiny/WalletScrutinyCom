## App Description from Google Play 

> You can send, receive and store bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies and digital assets safely and securely with the MDAO Wallet mobile app: CryptoWallet.

## Analysis 

- We were able to test the app and it gave us a mnemonic phrase
- The wallet supports Ethereum, BNB, TRON and Polygon 
- Despite claims of supporting BTC, there is **no support for the Bitcoin blockchain**
- We emailed them at support@ttmwallet.io to verify their claims.
