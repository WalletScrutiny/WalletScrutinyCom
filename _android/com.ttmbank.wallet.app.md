## Analysis 

This is the companion app to the TTM (ToTheMoon) KeyWallet. 

- You can pick between two choices.
    * To either create or restore a multi-coin wallet on the app  
    * To connect via NFC to the TTM KeyWallet.
- Choosing to create a wallet will give you a mnemonic phrase.
- The wallet allows you to choose between various networks including BTC, Ethereum, TRON, Polygon, or BNB Chain.

Although the wallet is self-custodial, the source code is currently **unavailable** and as such it is **not verifiable.**
