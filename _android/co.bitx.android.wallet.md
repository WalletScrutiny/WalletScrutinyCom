Luno: Buy Bitcoin, Ethereum and Cryptocurrency
advertises on the Playstore:

> **Keeping your crypto safe**<br>
> The majority of customer Bitcoin funds are kept in what we call “deep freeze” storage. These are multi-signature wallets, with private keys stored in different bank vaults. No single person ever has access to more than one key. We maintain a multi-signature hot wallet to facilitate instant Bitcoin withdrawals.

This tells us we are dealing with a custodial wallet here. Our verdict: **not
verifiable**.
