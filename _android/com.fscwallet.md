## Analysis 

- The listed website is no longer online.
- The last archive was made in 2022. 
- This app is curious since it claims to have three encryption methods: private key, mnemonic and keystore - making it appear to be self-custodial, but it won't even open. 
- The website archive on the other hand, describes it as a Global Trusted Digital Asset Trading Platform. 
- We emailed the developer at fscwallet@gmail.com.
- For now, we think this app is already **defunct**
