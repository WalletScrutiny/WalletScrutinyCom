This centralized cryptocurrency exchange also has a decentralized exchange. 

The centralized exchange allows for [deposit/withdrawal of cryptocurrencies](https://whitebit.com/faq#22) up to 2 BTC in value without KYC. Above that value, KYC would be needed.

Proof that this is a custodial service can be seen in White Bit's [terms](https://whitebit.com/terms)

> The Platform may set some restrictions on the Withdrawal the Funds and/or on the Transactions

Cold storage for the securing user funds is employed and this further indicates a **custodial** offering.
