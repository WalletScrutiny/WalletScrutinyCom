## App Description from Google Play

> Accept â‚¿itcoin, Lightning payments and on-chain instant payouts that convert to USD along with Venmo, Zelle, PayPal, and Cash App. What makes your profile special is a 0% transaction fee on all Bitcoin payments that get converted to USD instantly.
>
> You can also accept payments with no app needed. Using our smart Point of Sale system. We integrated our Tap to Pay technology with contactless technology.

## Analysis

- Registration involves inputting a separate Bitcoin address that is not generated through the app.
- As the app description says, payments are automatically converted to USD.
- There is a button to 'Activate' on the top menu. We tapped it and we received an error:

> Cannot connect to TaptoPay

- We understand this app as a form of Point-of-Sale system.
- No Bitcoin wallet addresses are generated and we had to generate our own to paste in the registration form.
- We also keep on seeing the same error noted above.
- This is **not a wallet**.
