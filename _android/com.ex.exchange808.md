## App Description

It has a very short description:

> Be a part of a world-class 808 Exchange
& Start Staking to get your daily Dividends!

This app is an exchange, and nothing indicates that it is not custodial.

## Critical Reviews

Notably, some of the 5* reviews are very suspicious. Some users report having problems with the exchange.

  ★☆☆☆☆ February 25, 2021 <br>
       I bought an order on this exchange back on the 31st of January 2021 and yet it's not fulfilled fully. I emailed their support three times but no reply. What's the use of this app if you don't reply in the support section and only fulfill a partial order? Don't use it.

       When I login to my no, this app charge 147.50 from my bank account ,whether it's not any permission. Don't install it..


## The Site

The site does not have that much information concerning the exchange. The Privacy Policy is just [a PDF file](https://808exchange.net/Privacy_Policy.pdf) and cannot be found through the website.

## The App

It's mandatory to register before using the app. To deposit you must choose a chain network: ERC20 Ethereum or BEP20 Binance Smart Chain and then the currency you want to deposit or withdraw. This includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, or {{ page.title }}'s custom token: 808TA. You are provided with a bitcoin address upon choosing to deposit.

## Verdict

We conclude that this exchange is most likely to be **custodial,** making it **non-verifiable.**
