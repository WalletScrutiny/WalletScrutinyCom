## The Site

From the [Terms of Use:](https://capitual.com/legal/terms-of-use)

> 3.7.1. We reserve the right to store values in offline storages. This is done as a security measure. For this reason, we might need to access assets stored offline. This may delay withdrawals operations.

As the terms talk about the provider storing the money, that insinuates that the user is not in control of the private keys.

There is a brief mention of private keys in [Capitual's explanation of crypto wallets](https://help.capitual.com/en/kb0102001/), but no sign that the user will be able to hold private keys.

## Verdict

Because this app leans towards being a **custodial** offering, its claims are **non-verifiable.**
