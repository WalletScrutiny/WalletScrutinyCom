## Analysis 

- This app isn't available for our device because it was made for an older version of Android. We were using Android 7.
- There is a domain listed in the Play Store developer contact: mydicewallet.com. There is only a Wix site notice informing us that a domain is not associated with a website.
- This is a **defunct** app.
