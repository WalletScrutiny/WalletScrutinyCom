## Analysis 

- At first glance, the app functions like {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.changelly.app' verdict='true' %}. The user can input an amount of a particular coin, to be exchanged to another coin. The user then inputs a corresponding third-party wallet. 
- The user can have an internal balance with the following coins:
  - BTC
  - ETH
  - LTC
  - XMR
  - DOGE
  - TRX
  - USDT
  - USDC
- The seed phrase was not provided for the internal balance of the BTC wallet.
- This app is **custodial** when the user stores the coins via the 'internal balance'.
