## Analysis 

- The [terms and conditions](https://ctskola.com/termsandconditions.pdf) for the service, describe both the account and the addresses associated with the user's funds as a "Custody Address".
- Most cryptocurrency exchanges that hosts user accounts on servers and offer multicurrency digital asset storage and exchange services, are **custodial** providers. This means they hold the private keys for the wallets. This is reflected by the fact that when users can't login to their platform, they simply cannot access their funds. The app is **non-verifiable**.
