The app description on Google Play is not very helpful. The homepage is no longer online. Archived version shows a suspended account. The app required a referral code - and we got about three, [which all resulted in errors](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1648899641315065856). We assume this to be **defunct** since the app is probably referencing from a source website which is no longer online.
