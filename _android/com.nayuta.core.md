## App Description

This bitcoin and lightning network app allows on-chain as well as lightning payments. It claims to be self-custodial and allows users to backup and restore from a 24 word seed.

However, according to its terms and conditions:

The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the Japan and foreign countries.

## Verdict

This app is self-custodial and though it claims to have "exclusive ownership" of the "original content, features and functionality", the wallet's source code is available on Github.
