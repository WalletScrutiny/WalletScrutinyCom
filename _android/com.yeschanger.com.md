## [Terms](https://yeschangers.com/terms.php) 

> The online site Yeschanger.com exchanges electronic currencies of the Payeer, Perfect Money, Advanced Cash, BITCOIN, ETHER, USDT, LTC and other types of EPS title systems using the services of banking institutions. The list of partners can be found on the information resource of the online exchange service Yeschanger.com.

## Does it or does it not have a wallet?

Access to the site's main features are restricted by their verification procedures. We contacted their support and [posted a screenshot of the conversation online](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1646410702188613633). 

We contacted support and they [said](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1646424060900024321) that the service "is not a Bitcoin wallet".

## Terms 

> 7. If the exchanger exchanges for Bitcoin cryptocurrency, then the passage of a transaction to a user in the Bitcoin network depends on the workload of the Bitcoin network itself

## Analysis 

This service is similar to:

- {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.shapeshift.droid_shapeshift' verdict='true' %}

- You provide a BTC (or some other coin) address
- You ask them for a USDT address (or some other payment method) to send to
- You send
- They send

This app **does not provide a bitcoin wallet**.
