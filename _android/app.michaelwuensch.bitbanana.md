## App Description from Google Play

> BitBanana is a native android app for node operators focused on user experience and ease of use. While it is not a wallet on its own, BitBanana works like a remote control allowing you to use your node as a wallet wherever you go. The app is designed with an educational approach, providing the user with guidance on every aspect of node operation.

## Analysis

While not explicitly a wallet, it does incorporate features that are akin to a wallet. The user initializes by connecting to a bitcoin lightning node. Once connected to a node, features such as backup, restore and other wallet features such as send and receive are made available. 

The provider has provided links to F-Droid and has self-described as reproducible. This app is [**for verification**](https://gitlab.com/walletscrutiny/walletScrutinyCom/-/issues/512)
