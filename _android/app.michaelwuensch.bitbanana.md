## App Description

This app's primary functionality is Lightning Node management. According to its own description, BitBanana is not a wallet on its own and instead works like a remote control allowing users to use lightning nodes as a wallet.

> ⚡️ Superpowers for you and your bitcoin lightning node! Use and manage your node wherever you are. ⚡️
>
> BitBanana is a native android app for node operators focused on user experience and ease of use.
While it is not a wallet on its own, BitBanana works like a remote control allowing you to use your node as a wallet wherever you go.
The app is designed with an educational approach, providing the user with guidance on every aspect of node operation.
>
> BitBanana is open source and fully self-custodial which means you are in full control or your funds.
>
> Features:
> - Manage multiple nodes
> - On-chain transactions and lightning payments
> - Channel management
> - Routing summary
> - Contacts
> - Sign/Verify
> - NFC support
> - Tor support
> - 100% open source
>... and many other features to explore!

## The App

The app requires you to connect to a remote node before making any transactions. You can choose to receive on-chain or through lightning. 
This app offers backup & restore functions, although it clearly states that:

> It does neither contain the seed to recover your on-chain funds, nor the channel backup to recover your lightning funds. The backups to recover your funds have to be made outside of BitBanana.

The backup DOES contain:

- The data that allows you to connect BitBanana to your running node.
- Contacts

## The Verdict

This app is **not a wallet.**
