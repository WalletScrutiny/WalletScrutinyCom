- The app only allows for a Turkish phone number.
- The exchange complies with a myriad of regulations including KYC, and those pertaining to financial crimes and terrorism. 
- The platform can also exercise several controls over the user's account in the event of account termination. 
- The documentation specifies support for BTC. 
- We did not find any provision for seed phrases. 
- It records all personally identifiable information including IP address and all transactions on the platform.
- Though we were not able to register with the service, we have sufficient proof that this app comes from a **custodial** provider.
