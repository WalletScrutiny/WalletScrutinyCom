## The App

We downloaded and registered in the app and found the option to deposit and withdraw BTC. As an exchange, other cryptocurrencies can also be deposited and withdrawn.

## Verdict

All indications point to a centralized, regulated, with KYC requirements, cryptocurrency exchange that is **custodial** and therefore **not verifiable.**
