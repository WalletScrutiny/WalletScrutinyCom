## App Description

It is described as a cryptocurrency exchange.

Its security features are self-described as:

> SECURITY：Multi-level and multi-cluster system architecture. More than 6 years of safe, stable infrastructure operating.

- [Law Requests Policy](https://www.zbg.com/help/kyc)

### Termination of Account

These provisions highlight the site's power to terminate the account, and hence the funds of the user.

> 9.1 The website is entitled to cancel your account according to the Terms and the Terms will terminate at the date of cancellation.

> 9.2 The website is entitled to terminate all services on the services according to the Terms and the Terms will terminate at the date of the termination of services.

## The App

We downloaded and registered in the app and found the option to deposit and withdraw BTC. As an exchange, other cryptocurrencies can also be deposited and withdrawn.

## Verdict

All indications point to a centralized, regulated, with KYC requirements, cryptocurrency exchange that is **custodial** and therefore **not verifiable.**
