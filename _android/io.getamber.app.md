## App Description from Google Play

> The world’s first purpose-built Bitcoin exclusive accumulation app.
>
> With 100% control to configure Bitcoin purchase, sell and withdraw actions to suit your preferences. Whether that’s inline with your payrun, saving or investment strategy – you choose!

### From the Website

> Your account, identity, and bitcoin are all secured using the latest collaborative custody, authentication and encryption standards.

## Analysis

- Amber uses [cold-storage](https://amber.app/faqs/) for storing bitcoin. They also have a "dispute window" or timeframe from the first purchase of bitcoin. The bitcoins can only be sent after this period of time.
- The presence of cold-storage mechanisms is a strong indicator of a **custodial** service.
