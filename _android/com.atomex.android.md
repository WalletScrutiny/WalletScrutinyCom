**Update 2022-02-12**: This app is not on the Store anymore.

> Atomex â€” is a non-custodial crypto wallet

and it also supports Bitcoin and ...

> Atomex is an open-source project by the Baking Bad team, which is known in the
  Tezos community as one of the most active ecosystem contributors.

and indeed their linked GitHub account has a repository that looks promising:
[atomex-me/atomex.mobile](https://github.com/atomex-me/atomex.mobile).

Unfortunately at this point I have to give up as this is the first project we
review that was built in Visual Studio using C#. As there are no build
instructions I can only hope for
[help from the provider](https://github.com/atomex-me/atomex.mobile/issues/24)
and conclude for now that the app is **not verifiable**.
