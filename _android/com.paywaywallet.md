This app looks like BitRefill in its features and also its property as a wallet:
It's not advertised as being a wallet but in the screenshots you see an available
balance in crypto currencies, so it is also a wallet.

As the app requires login and password, it looks like an interface to a
custodial service.

[Their FAQ](https://help.payway.ug/wallet/faq/) features weird answers in form
of screenshots that don't answer the question. "What is the maximum amount I can
send?" Answer: Some numbers without unit.

Either way, daily limits are not common in actual non-custodial wallets, so again
this looks custodial.

Our verdict: **not verifiable**.
