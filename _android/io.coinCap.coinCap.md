The app's description reads as follows:

> CoinCap keeps you up to date on the status of your crypto with real-time market data and tracking features. Thereâ€™s never a bad time for crypto, which is why access to accurate, reliable data is a must - anytime, anywhere. No account or sign-up required.

This app cannot access your private keys as it is **not a wallet.**
