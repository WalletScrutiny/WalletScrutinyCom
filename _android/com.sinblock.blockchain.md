## Analysis 

- This looks like a cryptocurrency exchange.
- Registration was pretty straightforward. Users can choose to register via phone or email. 
- The app's language is mixed with English and Chinese characters.
- We were not given a mnemonic phrase during registration and there was no wallet creation phase.
- We found a Bitcoin wallet with a P2SH address
- There was no option to back up the private keys in the settings.
- The terms explicitly describe a **custodial** platform, making this app **non-verifiable**.
