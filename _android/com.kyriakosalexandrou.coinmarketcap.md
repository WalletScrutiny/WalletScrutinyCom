## The Site

The site [FAQ](https://www.dopamineapp.com/faq.html) details that it is the successor to the CMA app. It is also possible to [buy Bitcoin from the platform](https://www.dopamineapp.com/faq.html). 

The FAQ, also mentions that it is possible to send/receive cryptocurrencies using its self-custodial app. 

We were not able to find the source code on the site. We queried their [twitter account](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1446021588881530882) for feedback.

## The App

We downloaded the app and no registration was needed. All they asked for was a password. They then provided a 12-word seed.

After that, we found the 'Add Wallet - Bitcoin' option. Two options were then available: Create a wallet and Import a Wallet. It then possible to copy the WIF (Wallet Import Format). It is composed of 52 characters.

## Verdict

They service claims to offer a self-custodial app, but we were **not able to find a verifiable and public source code**.
