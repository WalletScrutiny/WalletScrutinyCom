**Update 2021-08-04**: Since 2021-07-22 the app is not on Play Store anymore.
We don't know any details but also noticed that
**"Bithumb Global-Bitcoin, crypto exchange  & wallet"** renamed to
{% include walletLink.html wallet='android/global.bithumb.android' verdict='true' %}
which might or might not have to do with {{ page.title }} which has the appId
`com.btckorea.bithumba`.

# Old Analysis

This app appears to be the korean version of
{% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.btckorea.bithumb' %}. Google Translate doesn't reveal any
substantial difference. We conclude it is a custodial offering and **not verifiable**.
