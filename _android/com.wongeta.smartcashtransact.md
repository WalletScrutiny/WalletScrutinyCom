## Analysis 

- We tried registering with the service, but had an error which we [screenshotted](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1667440556614602753).
- We found that the web version of the registration page also exhibited the same error. 
- From the [Terms](https://mysmartcash.tech/Home/TermsAndCondition#), we find that in Section 14.2, the provider can stop the user from having access to the platform. This is clearly a **custodial** characteristic.
- This app was just updated a month ago. We'll contact info@mysmartcash.tech (found on the website) and temporarily mark this as **custodial** until new information is made available.
