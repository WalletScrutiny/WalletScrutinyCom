## Analysis 

- We could not find the site's Terms and Conditions
- We managed to successfully register after several tries (delayed OTP and delayed verification email)
- We found a Bitcoin Wallet that can send and receive.
- We were **not** able to find an option to backup or restore the private keys. 
- Absent the options to backup the private keys, we see this app as a **custodial** one.
