From the [FAQ:](https://c-exchange.com/faq)

> In order to sell Bitcoins on c-Exchange, you'll first need to send some Bitcoins to your c-Exchange Wallet. To find your c-Exchange receiving address, simply visit the Wallet page and click the 'Generate new address' button. At the top of the page, you'll find your unique receiving address. Please note that you can still use the old address, but it will eventually expire after 12 months. Once you have your c-Exchange receiving address, you can easily transfer Bitcoins from your other wallet to your c-Exchange address.
