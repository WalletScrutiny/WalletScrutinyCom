## Analysis 

They have investment packages:
 
> - USD 500 to 220,000 for 1 year - 0.50% profit daily
> - USD 3,000 to 12,000 for 5 years - 0.35% profit daily
> - USD 5,000 to 25,000 for 10 years - 0.41% profit daily

- Once in the main interface, we click on "New Deposit". We label it arbitrarily. 
- The next screen that appears lists 'investment packages' in cards. We selected the 500 to 220,000 card and clicked on the 'proceed to amount' button. 
- The choices were:
    - credit/debit card
    - bank transfer
    - coinbase
    - bank transfer
- We were **not able to find any btc wallet address** on the platform.
- When we clicked on 'Buy Bitcoin', the app redirected us to a Coinbase login page.
- Despite their claims of being able to trade cryptocurrencies, we do not believe this app functions similar to mainstream cryptocurrency trading apps such as {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.binance.dev' verdict='true' %} or {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.coinbase.pro' verdict='true' %}. This appears more like a platform where the user sends cryptocurrency to the platform's own wallet to be "invested" in their long-term offerings.
