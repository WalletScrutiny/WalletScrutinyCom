## Analysis 

We tested the app. [(Screenshot)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1652262040474648576)

The exchange provided a Bitcoin wallet that can send and receive subject to the restrictions as quoted above. We were not able to find any option to backup or import the private keys. 

This is a **custodial** provider.
