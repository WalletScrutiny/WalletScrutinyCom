       SCAAAAAAAAAM They will request to deposit to your wallet from out source like binance to activate your account with minimum 0.01 BTC! After you did that and wanna withdraw from Coinals you will get ERROR msg, then they will till you to despite again with 5% from your money in coinals!!! DO NOT DEAL WITH THEM THE MONEY IS JUST A NUMBER NOT LIKE OTHER EXCHANGE!

## The App

[We tried out the app](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1461168102629003267). Notably, it attempted to load the webpage: [coinals.com.](https://coinals.com/)

As seen in the screenshots, the page did not load. As a result, we are obligated to classify this app as **defunct.**
