## Analysis 

- The website is no longer online 
- We emailed the developer in the provided email address from Google Play: cokkieswallet@gmail.com
- We installed the app. But when it came to creating the new wallet, the app does not show the seed phrases. Clicking on the "I've written it down" button closes the app. 
- While we await the response from the developer, we'll keep this app as a work-in-progress.
