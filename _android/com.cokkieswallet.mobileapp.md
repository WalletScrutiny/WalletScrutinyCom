## Analysis 

- The website is no longer online 
- We emailed the developer in the provided email address from Google Play: cokkieswallet@gmail.com
- We installed the app. But when it came to creating the new wallet, the app does not show the seed phrases. Clicking on the "I've written it down" button closes the app. 
- They have not responded for a significant period of time, thus we are marking this as **defunct**
