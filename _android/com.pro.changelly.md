## App Description
Changelly PRO is an exchange:

> Changelly PRO is a crypto exchange platform that serves both professional cryptocurrency traders and novices. The BTC exchange objective is to deliver simplicity to crypto trading — as well as high liquidity, competitive fees, and 24/7 support. 

Here is its claim on security:

> **Top-notch Account Security:** Be sure your crypto assets are protected with 2-factor authentication with high-end encryption technology and email confirmations.

However, nothing else really indicates the prescence of a crypto wallet.

It is related to {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.changelly.app/' verdict='true' %}, an exchange that claimed to be non-custodial as it only held funds for the purpose of exchanging them. This seems not to be the case for Changelly PRO.

## The Site
On the site, [one page has instructions](https://support.changelly.com/en/support/solutions/articles/14000111647-how-to-withdraw-funds-step-by-step-) for withdrawing funds on Changelly PRO.

There is also an article [on KYC verification.](https://support.changelly.com/en/support/solutions/articles/14000111665-what-is-kyc-verification-and-how-to-get-verified-)


### User Agreement

> In the event of termination, Company will return any crypto assets **stored in your Account** and not owed to Company, unless Company believes you have committed fraud, negligence or other misconduct.

This means the company is in charge of the user's assets.

## Verdict
This app is **custodial** and thus  **not verifiable.**
