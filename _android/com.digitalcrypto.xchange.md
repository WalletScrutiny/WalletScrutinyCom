## Analysis 

- The app has no listed website 
- We tried installing the app in BlueStacks 5 Android Pie, and it did not show anything but a blank screen. 
- We tried again in BlueStacks 5 Android Nougat, and it showed the same blank white screen. 
- We'll email the provider to ask about the app at the listed email address: sunwaytradingcompany@gmail.com
- Based from the description, the app seems to be a **custodial** app, but without the ability to test it, we can't really know for sure. One thing we can get from this is the app is no longer working properly, and is thus, **defunct**.
