The app's description:

> As a non-custodial wallet, funds will always remain in your full control, with
  effortless wallet backup and recovery options.

Unfortunately we can't find any source code. No such link on their website and
neither can we find anything relevant on GitHub which leads to the verdict:
**not verifiable**.
