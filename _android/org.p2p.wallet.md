## Analysis 

- We installed the app 
- We can choose a username with a suffix of ".key". Other users can send coins to this similar to email. 
- The currencies available are USDC, Solana, Ethereum, and USDT. 
- Swapping is possible, with wBTC and other coins. 
- Its claims relating to bitcoin is a little bit inaccurate. What is has are the following:
  - soBTC
  - wBTC
  - renBTC
  - sBTC-8
  - HBTC
  - ibBTC
  - sBTC-9 
- These are mostly tokenized versions of Bitcoin primarily in the Solana blockchain. 
- They provided the seed phrases 
- Despite these, this app **does not support Bitcoin** on the Bitcoin blockchain.
