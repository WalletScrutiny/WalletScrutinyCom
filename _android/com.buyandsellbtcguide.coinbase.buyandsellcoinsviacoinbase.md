       Scam, be aware!!!!!!!
       
### App

We downloaded and installed the app. There was no registration. The first thing that appeared was an ad. Then it appears that the app only contains blog posts:

- What is bitcoin
- how Bitcoin works
- How to get Bitcoin
- Where does Bitcoin come from?
- Which nonprofits accept crypto?
- How to set up a crypto wallet
- What is cryptocurrency
- the future of finance

## Verdict

This app **does not have a bitcoin wallet**.
