## Analysis 

- Curiously, the app is still in beta-access despite being updated almost 2 years ago. 
- We tried registering but had difficulty both on the virtual device and on a real phone. The circle status just kept circling with no other feedback.
- When we clicked on the Terms and Conditions link, it showed a short message:

> Online Card Games and betting may be illegal under the laws of your country of residence or the country where you are currently located. In such cases, you may not make use of the services of the company. 
>
> The company will not assume any liability whatsoever in this regard and will not reimburse you for any disadvantages you might suffer as a consequence of the violation of any legal provisions that may be applicable to you. It is your sole responsibility to ensure that you act, at all times, in accordance with the statutory provisions applicable to you.

> Restricted Region List: Botswana, Cambodia, Central African Republic, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Republic of Seychelles, Ethiopia, Ghana, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Syria, Sudan, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Venezuela, Yemen, and the United States of America (herein "Prohibited Jurisdictions").

- We will email the provider at: euphoriawallet@yandex.ru
- The email promptly bounced with an error:

- We [tweeted](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1661214829309198338) them as well.
- For the meanwhile, we would go with the description, specifically "**All assets in app aren't real, they represent the test versions due to beta-testing**", and thus, give a verdict of **not a wallet**
