## App Description from Google Play

> The reliable and secure mobile crypto wallet. Easy done.
Vuollet is the safe place for your coins, with the easiest tools to buy and sell cryptocurrency.

## Analysis 

- The website is no longer online. 
- An [archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20220315025330/https://vuollet.io/) of the site, shows that time-delayed vault withdrawals are a feature of the app. 
- They also claim that a huge percentrage of user funds are stored in offline-storage. 
- The storage of funds in offline-storage necessarily means that the private keys are in their custody, making this service **custodial**. This also makes the app **not-verifiable**.
