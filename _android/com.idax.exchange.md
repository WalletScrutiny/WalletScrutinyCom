## Analysis 

- This is a cryptocurrency exchange.
- It is possible to deposit and withdraw bitcoins
- There is a [termination clause] which allows the exchange to suspend the user's ability to move funds:

> 9.1.    Suspension of DAX Accounts
> You agree that DAX shall have the right to immediately suspend your DAX Account (and any accounts beneficially owned by related entities or affiliates), freeze or lock the Digital Assets or funds in all such accounts, and suspend your access to DAX for any reason including if DAX suspects any such accounts to be in violation of these Terms, our Privacy Policy, or any applicable laws and regulations. 

The ability to freeze or lock the user's funds is a good sign that this is a **custodial** provider.
