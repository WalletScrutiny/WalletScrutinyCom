## App Description

Translated from Russian, the description gives the impression that this app is simply a money transfer.

> International transfers for 0%. The Zamzam mobile application is a profitable, fast and secure way to transfer money from Russia to the CIS countries. (Soon not only from Russia).

There's no information on crypto in the app description.

## The Site

On the homepage:

> Zamzam Mobile App is a profitable and fast way to transfer money abroad from Russia to the CIS countries

There's nothing about cryptocurrencies here.

## The App

Nothing on the app indicates you can deposit or send cryptocurrencies.

## Verdict

This is **not a crypto wallet.**
