  transactions in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT

You can send and receive:

> You can receive, send, and store cryptocurrencies using a convenient and
  secure cryptowallet within your account, as well as trade securely with other
  people on Bitpapa P2P marketplace

And ... it's custodial:

Free transactions works if it's updates to their database. The blockchain is not
free ever.
