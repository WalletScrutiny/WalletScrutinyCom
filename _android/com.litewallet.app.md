**Update 2024-06-7**: 
We have already addressed an issue with the developers regarding the challenges faced during the application development process. You can view the details of this conversation here: [https://github.com/META-1-Official/litewallet-native/issues/95](https://github.com/META-1-Official/litewallet-native/issues/95).

Numerous 'litewallets' are accessible online, yet none explicitly pertain to this application.

Detailed logs are available in the issue mentioned above.

Our verdict: The absence of several critical production environment variables, combined with the fact that the last update occurred two years ago, leads us to declare the project unverifiable.
**not verifiable**.
