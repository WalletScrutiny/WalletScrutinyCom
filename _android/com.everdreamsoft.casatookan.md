## Update 2024-07-24

There is no indication that this app's source code is available to the public. Searching for the [app ID on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=%22com.everdreamsoft.casatookan%22&type=code) does not turn out relevant results.

## Review 2023-07-17

> This Bitcoin-Ethereum mobile wallet for blockchain gamers & collectors securely and privately store your digital assets and collections. Your digital estate is protected by a secure 12 words passphrase to ensure you are the only custodian of your digital property.
>
> Casa Tookan contains an integrated dapp browser, a dedicated news feed and other useful features. Its intuitive interface makes trading a breeze.

We downloaded the app and created a wallet. We were provided with a 12-word phrase and asked to set a PIN. The wallet supports BTC, ETH, and BCY. Users must enter their PIN codes to access the Bitcoin WIF.

We could not find any indication that this product is open-source or that the code is available for review.
