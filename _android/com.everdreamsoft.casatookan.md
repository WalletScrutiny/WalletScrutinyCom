We downloaded the app and created a wallet. We were provided with a 12-word phrase and asked to set a PIN. The wallet supports BTC, ETH, and BCY. Users must enter their PIN codes to access the Bitcoin WIF.

We could not find any indication that this product is open-source or that the code is available for review.
