       Hi, this exchange is a scam, they steal crypto of customers. I sent my crypto to them but it's not deposited. I contacted them for support that my crypto is lost but they kept on passing time for weeks that team is working. Mine loss was 1000$. Guys There are other exchanges to trade please don't get into their trap they are more or less a scammers

       Terrible and useless don't use this exchange, deposits and withdrawals can take weeks to be carried out. Same with trades. Completely useless customer service. Go to another trading platform.
