## The App

Bitcoin Libre caters specifically to WBTC or Wrapped Bitcoin. So it's an ERC-20 token. It can send and receive. It can be backed up and restored from a 12-word seed.

## Verdict

WBTC, an ERC-20 token claims to be backed up by real Bitcoin reserves. They also claim that it's possible to send to [other BTC addresses through a WBTC partner (Coinbase Article)](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/crypto-education/wbtc)

While this may be the case, WBTC is still on another blockchain. Thus, it is still an Ethereum token with additional third party risk, making this **not a BTC wallet**.
