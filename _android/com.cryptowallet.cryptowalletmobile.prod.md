  ★☆☆☆☆ November 15, 2021 <br>
        The KYC validation process for new accts is really tedious and keep having failed validation over a number of tries due to some misalightment of requirements in user info... Unable to self edit or resubmit, only solution to fix this is to email directly to them.

## Verdict

This app is **custodial** but also **defunct**. Users on the Play Store appear
to have been barred from registration since November and there has been no
response from the dev team.
