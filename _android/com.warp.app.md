## App Description 

This is a Binance Smart Chain based DeFi app that uses PancakeSwap. The app is self-custodial. Upon installation the following steps were followed: 

1. Advanced Setup - Get full control of your wallet
- manage your wallet yourself, so only you own your private recovery information. Any loss can make recovery impossible.

2. Create or restore a wallet

3. Mnemonic phrase backup

## Verdict

Although it seems that a Bitcoin wallet is supported because of the app description, this app **does not generate a BTC address**. It cannot receive bitcoins. Oddly, it can send bitcoins. There is a way to acquire bitcoins and that is through *swapping* using the app.
