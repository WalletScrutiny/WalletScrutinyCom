## Analysis

- The app provider claims their wallet supports sending and receiving Bitcoin and is non-custodial.
- There were no claims regarding source-availability. A code search on GitHub for the app ID, [does not yield any result](https://github.com/search?q=com.blockchaincommodities.hippo_wallet&type=code).
- We were given the seed phrases during wallet creation. The app has a BTC wallet that can send/receive.
- This app is **not source-available.**
