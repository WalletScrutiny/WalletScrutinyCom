## App Description from Google Play

> Earn bitcoin by completing tasks in the app. Easily start making bitcoins by taking surveys, sending opinions, watching videos, testing, giving endorsements… with fast payments directly to your Bitcoin wallet.

## Analysis 

[Video of testing](https://x.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1831993922593456177)

As the description states, users can earn "Bitcoin" by performing some tasks. Although the amounts in the balance have a BTC as its denomination, in other parts of the app, the amount is described as credits that have an equivalent amount in Bitcoin. Users would have to request the amount to be withdrawn. 

The developers recommend the {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.wirex' verdict='true' %} app as a wallet.

This app **does not function as a wallet**.
