## Analysis 

- [Deposits](https://www.invesacapital.com/international/faqs/deposit/#q01) are only possible through credit/debit cards, electronic payment, and wire transfer. Withdrawals are processed in the same way as deposits.
- CFD BTCUSD is available for trading. 
- This means that the app **cannot send/receive actual bitcoins**, but the user can buy or sell CFDs representing the cryptocurrencies. The app therefore, is **non-verifiable**.
