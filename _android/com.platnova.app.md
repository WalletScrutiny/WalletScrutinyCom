## Analysis 

- The app required strict submission of personal documents that's why we were not able to register. 
- Initially, we did not find any mention of "bitcoin", "crypto", or "private key" in all of their web content. 
- It was only later on when we found this [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/company/platnova/?miniCompanyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniCompany%3A80212186&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BAZQ3KqbPRoWF0okG3osWCw%3D%3D) that details the process wherein users could buy bitcoin on the platform. The user has to input a BTC address to receive the coins. This means that this app does **not offer a bitcoin wallet**.
