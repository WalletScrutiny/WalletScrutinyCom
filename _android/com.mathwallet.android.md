- The default BTC node is a Chinese named node
- The seed phrases were provided
- There is support for segwit and taproot
- The app is self-custodial

## Reproducibility?

In MathWallet's official GitHub profile we found a repository where its Playstore app ID was referenced. [MathWallet5SDK-Android](https://github.com/mathwallet/MathWallet5SDK-Android). The repository houses MathWallet's SDK, however that's all it is. There is no source code to use it with.

MathWallet's profile houses a different repository called ["MathChain"](https://github.com/mathwallet/MathChain) which is a different project entirely.
