Notably, it features a generic descriptor as its app title "{{page.title}}" while the app's description claims it's called "Fintap.app" and the Play store id is `{{page.appId}}`.

The Play Store description states...

> Be confident in your funds: our EON blockchain has existed since 2018, and Fintap.app is a blockchain wallet with a private key that is generated and stored only on the user’s side.

the provider is claiming the wallet is non-custodial.

However despite the app's frequent updates no source code can be found in a public repository.

Our verdict: This ‘wallet’ claims to be non-custodial, however with no source code for validation this is **not verifiable**.
