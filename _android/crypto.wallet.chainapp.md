## Analysis 

- The app was previously marked as defunct, despite being online. 
- We had to download the APK from a third-party site, as the app is not available in our geolocation. It did not work, so we used a VPN to try to get past the geo-restrictions. 
- We were finally able to install on BlueStacks 5 Android 9 using a Japan ip address. 
- The app has a BTC wallet that can send/receive 
- The app also provided a mnemonic phrase. 
- We **found no reference regarding source-availability**. We also did not find a corresponding GitHub repository using the app ID.
