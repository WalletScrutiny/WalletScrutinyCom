## App Description

Bottrex is not an exchange or wallet, it is a trading bot. It connects to exchanges via API.

> Bottrex is a trading robot that trades Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies **on the world's largest exchanges.**

The app description even lists exchanges that this bot functions on:

> Automate your trading on the main market exchanges: Binance, Bittrex, Huobi, HitBTC, Kucoin, Bitfinex, OKEX, BitcoinTrade, NovaDAX and FTX.

Here's a [tutorial](https://support.bottrex.net/en/articles/61/connect-your-bot-to-huobi) on how to connect Bottrex with huobi.
