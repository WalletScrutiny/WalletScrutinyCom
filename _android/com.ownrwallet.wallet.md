So this app claims to be a partner of Bitfinex, one of the biggest exchanges:

> - OWNR is an official partner of Bitfinex. 

yet we can't find anywhere that Bitfinex would link to this app. Bitfinex has
[their own app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitfinex.mobileapp)
which we will also review shortly.

Bitfinex' Twitter account gets spammed "ownr" **at them** a lot but there is no
mention of that name **by them**. That looks fishy. Maybe they reply to
[this tweet](https://twitter.com/LeoWandersleb/status/1333912501378048002).

In the light of the above, we take the claims:

> - Restore HD-wallets with any seed phrase length (12/15/18/21/24 words)
> 
> - Only you sign the transactions and own your keys â€“ we do no store them on our servers
> 
> Your seed phrase is stored on your device only

with a lot of skepticism and assume this app to be custodial until further
notice from Bitfinex.
