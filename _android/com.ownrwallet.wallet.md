So this app claims to be a partner of Bitfinex, one of the biggest exchanges:

> OWNR is an official partner of Bitfinex.

which surprised us as Bitfinex has
[their own app](https://www.bitfinex.com/mobile-trading/).

We asked them in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/LeoWandersleb/status/1333912501378048002) and in the replies we indeed get a pointer to
[this post](https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/558) which convinces us that this app
indeed is endorsed by Bitfinex. (If you have a better link, we would happily
add it if it explains why they have two wallets.)

Maybe this is the non-custodial one?

> - Restore HD-wallets with any seed phrase length (12/15/18/21/24 words)  
> - Only you sign the transactions and own your keys â€“ we do no store them on
    our servers
> - Your seed phrase is stored on your device only

They certainly do claim to be non-custodial but as we can't find any source
code, we remain with a verdict of **not verifiable**.
