## Update 2024-07-22

A quick Google search brought us a '[unidocore](https://github.com/unidocore)' profile on GitHub which links to this app's site and twitter. However none of the repositories were eligible for reproducibility testing. This app's claims will remain **not verifiable.**

## Old Review 2023-06-10

## App Description from Google Play 

> Unido offers enterprise-level crypto self-custody solutions for SMEs, sophisticated corporations and institutions that want to leap into crypto, invest in DeFi and provide crypto access to their customers.
>
> Our technology is based on a state-of-the-art fragmented private key-signing engine that enables enterprises to distribute transaction signing at the blockchain level. That, combined with our user-friendly dashboard and point-and-click business tools, provides enterprises with the level of corporate governance workflow and security they require to confidently do business on the blockchain.

## Analysis 

- We were able to install the app, and created two passwords 
- The mnemonic phrase was given to us. 
- There is a BTC wallet that can send/receive. 
- We were **not able to find claims or related repositories that are publicly-available**.
