## Analysis 

- We initially tried to run this app on BlueStacks 5 Pie, and on our phone. Both issued the same error: (Translated from Chinese)

> "The server is abnormal. Please try again later."

- The website associated with this app, betepal.com is offline. 
- We emailed the developer contact: betepal888@gmail.com to inquire about their app. 
- Given that this app was updated just in 2022, we'll leave this as a **work-in-progress** though we have reason to believe that it is already defunct. We'll wait for the feedback of the developer.
