## App Description from Google Play 

The description mostly talks about the provider's financial performance and that investors should invest in it. 

## Analysis 

- The website domain is listed under the email contact. It is no longer online 
- The earliest archive entry was made in [2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210315143903/http://pulsarbank.com/)
- There are allegations of lost funds in [TrustPilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/pulsarbank.com)
- When we opened the app, it merely gave an error: 

> Connection problem 

- Most of the time, network or connection problems at the initialization of the app signal a **defunct** app. Add an offline homepage, vague app descriptions and negative reviews, old update dates, and you have an app that is more or less abandoned already.
