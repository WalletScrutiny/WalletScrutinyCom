## Analysis 

- The app's homepage is a blogspot blog for a person named: Bhavesh Dudhat
- When the app first opens, 2 buttons appear: Claim 1 and Claim 2. It has something to do with faucets. 
- Clicking on Claim 1, opened yet another page with 2 Google ads with a button labeled "Go to Claim". 
- Clicking on "Go to Claim" opens another page, which informed us that we can receive 2 satoshis every 5 minutes. There were also 2 Google ads. The only other button is home. 
- We clicked it and it showed a video advertisement about "Instant Payouts to Paypal" if we install another app.
- This is **not a wallet**, and it would be best to stay away from this app.
