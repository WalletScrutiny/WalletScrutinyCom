## Analysis 

- We registered an account and no mnemonics were provided. 
- We could not find a setting to back up the private keys. 
- Some [restrictions](https://support.capecrypto.com/hc/en-za/articles/360011483098-How-do-I-withdraw-cryptocurrency-from-my-Cape-Crypto-account-) are in place:
  - Users cannot withdraw cryptocurrency without verifying their accounts. 
  - Users can have their accounts locked if flagged for suspicious transactions.
  - Funds can be confiscated.
  - Provider will cooperate with authorities when requested.

Although not directly stated or described. The lack of private key backup mechanism and other signifiers indicate this to be a **custodial** provider with a **non-verifiable** app.
