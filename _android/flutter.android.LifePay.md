## Analysis

- As of 2024-09-07, the app only supports lightning. On-chain Bitcoin wallet functions are not available.
- No private keys were provided when we signed up. 
- Instead, we were given a `@lifpay.me` account. This was denominated in sats. 
- Absent the private keys, this is a **custodial service**.
