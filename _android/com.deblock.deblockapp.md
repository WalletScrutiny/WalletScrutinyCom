## Analysis 

*Note: The app is only available for tax residents of France or France's oversea territories.*


Deblock is a France-based app that claims to offer an alternative self-custodial security system. Instead of the user memorizing a seed phrase, this app generates two "shards" of a key: one generated on the user's device and the other on Deblock's servers. Both parts are then encrypted and "backed up".

As stated on the [official website:](https://deblock.com/en-FR/best-non-custodial-wallets-in-the-world)

> Your shard of the key (2) <br>
    - Generated upon signup on your device. <br>
    - Encrypted and backed-up in case you lose your phone.
>
> Deblock's shard of the key (1) <br>
    - Generated upon signup on Deblock's server. <br>
    - Encrypted and stored in cold storage, in case a meteorite strikes our data centre.

You can “request your private key at any point in time.” According to the article linked earlier:

> The app will download Deblock's encrypted shard🔒 and decrypt it in your device. The app will use your shard and Deblock’s shard on your device to reconstruct the wallet's private key and your seed phrase.

There's a warning: 

> If you decide to use your wallet’s private key outside of the Deblock ecosystem, we will have to close your Deblock account

In the section “What if Deblock disappears?” (and you have neither the app nor a backup), an Emergency Recovery Process is outlined: If Deblock vanishes and the user has no app or backup, an "independent third party" will provide a decryption SDK to release both shards of the private key from cold storage. This includes the user’s half of the private key, implying that third parties effectively control the private key making this app **not verifiable.**
