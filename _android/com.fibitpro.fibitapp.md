## Analysis 

- According to the [terms](https://fibitpro.com/terms), upon signing up, the user will be provided with a wallet that is subject to the agreement.
- The provider may suspend accounts and wallets at any time for reasons given in the terms.
- There is a BTC wallet but with a notice that deposits are currently suspended. 
- The mnemonic phrase was not given during registration. 
- There was no option to back up the private keys.
- Withdrawals have to be requested.
- These point to a **custodial** app.
