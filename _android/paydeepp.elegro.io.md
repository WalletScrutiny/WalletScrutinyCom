We have no idea what they claim here:

> elegro Wallet is currently the only solution you can use to buy things for
  crypto in brick-and-mortar stores.

And this one?

> 100% fund safety - Blockchain technologies ensure the highest possible fund protection.

We have seen many apps disappear their users' funds, which is precisely why we
have a closer look.

... and here is an amusing review exchange which in their defense is the only
1-star comment:

> **joey levy**:<br>
  This app is the worst sent money and never got it then their emails bounced
  back stole money from me watch out crooks<br>
  **Niko Technologies**:<br>
  This is our ex-CEO who took the company's money. Please, ignore the review.

But we can't find any claims about who has the keys so we assume it is a
custodial wallet and thus **not verifiable**.
