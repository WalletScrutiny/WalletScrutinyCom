## The Site

In Terms of Service, [Termination of Account:](https://zupago.app/terms-of-service)

> ZuPago reserves the right to restrict, suspend or terminate your ZuPago Account at our discretion if we suspect that you have failed to comply with these Terms, pose an unacceptable fraud risk to us, or if you provide any false, incomplete, inaccurate or misleading information. We will not be liable to you for any losses that you incur in connection with our closure or suspension of your account. 

## The App

Once the user registers an account, the app will allow you to create an account. The wallet offers multiple currencies, including BTC, Bitcoin-Cash, Litecoin, or Dogecoin. Before the user can withdraw, the app requires you to "complete your profile" via filling in a form with personal information.

There appears to be no way to access a mnemonic. 

## Verdict

The app is **custodial** and **not verifiable.**
