## Analysis 

- We installed the app but failed to register. [(Screenshot)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1653690303675785216). 
- The last time this app was updated was in 2019. 
- We will email the provider to ask about the status of the project, if the claims in its description are correct, then the app should be self-custodial. However, it **doesn't make any claims about whether the app provides its source code publicly.**
