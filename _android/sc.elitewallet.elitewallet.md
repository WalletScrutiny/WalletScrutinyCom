## App Description from Google Play

> Elite Wallet respects your privacy and allows you to safely store, exchange, and spend your Monero, Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Haven. Elite Wallet is focused on high privacy standards.
>
> Features of Elite Wallet:
>
> - Completely noncustodial and open-source. Your keys, your coins
> - Easily exchange between BTC, LTC, XMR, and dozens of other cryptocurrencies
> - Buy Bitcoin/Litecoin with credit/debit/bank and sell Bitcoin by bank transfer
> - Create multiple Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero, and Haven wallets
> - You control your own seed and keys, including your Monero private view key

## Analysis 

- The app's homepage is currently offline, but is available via [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20230305015316/https://elitewallet.sc/)
- We successfully installed the app, and it describes itself as:
  > *Awesome wallet for Monero, bitcoin, Litecoin, and Haven*
  > - With standard anonymity, no proxy server is used. 
  > - With advanced anonymity, Elite proxy server is used to anonymize internet traffic
  > - Elite anonymity uses a custom proxy server to anonymize internet traffic
- We tested standard anonymity and created a wallet.
- We assigned a 4-digit pin.
- We chose Bitcoin (Electrum) as the wallet currency and assigned 'test' as the wallet name.
- The 24-word seed phrases were provided.
- We were provided with a Bech32 BTC address
- The seed phrases can be backed-up via the security and backup settings.

We failed to build the app from source after several attempts over a time period.

## Build Attempt 2024-06-10

- There have been several attempts to build this app and several related issues:
  - **2023-02-16** - Emanuel raised [issue No.6](https://github.com/Elite-Labs/EliteWallet/issues/6) in the elitewallet repository, concerning incorrect build instructions. Changes were applied to the [Elitewallet Android build guide](https://github.com/Elite-Labs/EliteWallet/blob/main/howto-build-android.md).
  - **2024-04-26** - Chad was able to create a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/Elite-Labs/EliteWallet/issues/12#issuecomment-2078036154). The last time we attempted to build this, we failed due to:
> 
>  FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
>
> * Where:
> Script '/home/developer/elite_wallet/.flutter/packages/flutter_tools/gradle/flutter.gradle' line: 1201
> 
> * What went wrong:
> Execution failed for task ':app:compileFlutterBuildRelease'.
> Process 'command '/home/developer/elite_wallet/.flutter/bin/flutter'' finished with non-zero exit value 1

A complete [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/cGknq5Y1) of the build.log is available.

## Build Attempt 2024-06-11 

Based on the instructions for an [automatic build](https://github.com/Elite-Labs/EliteWallet/issues/12#issuecomment-2078036154), we created a dockerfile to isolate the process:

  - Used latest Ubuntu LTS version as base image
  - Set environment variables for Android SDK and Flutter
  - Install system dependencies
  - Install Android SDK
  - Install Android NDK
  - Install Flutter
  - Download and extract Gradle Wrapper with no ownership change
  - Create a non-root user for security
  - Switch to the appuser
  - Clone the EliteWallet repository
  - Set working directory
  - Build dependencies
  - Build the app

This encountered multiple errors related to permissions. This is the tail-end:

The original exception was: ProcessException: The command failed with exit code 2

```

I then try to extract Gradle as the root user by modifying these lines:

```
# Install Flutter
RUN git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git "$FLUTTER_ROOT" && \
    "$FLUTTER_ROOT/bin/flutter" precache

# Download and extract Gradle Wrapper
RUN wget -O /tmp/gradle-wrapper.tgz https://dl.google.com/android/repository/gradle-wrapper-7.4.2-all.zip && \
    tar -xzf /tmp/gradle-wrapper.tgz -C /opt/flutter/bin/cache/artifacts/gradle_wrapper && \
    rm /tmp/gradle-wrapper.tgz

# Create a non-root user for security
RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash appuser

# Switch to the appuser
USER appuser
WORKDIR /home/appuser
```

I then run the test script again. and received an identical error pertaining to Gradle and Flutter: 

```

/usr/bin/tar: gradlew.bat: Cannot change ownership to uid 397546, gid 5000: Invalid argument
```

The fix was to `manually download and extract the Gradle Wrapper with the --no-same-owner flag.`

It worked, and now we address a different problem, it cannot find the build_deps.sh script which should be in "scripts" directory. An excerpt:

```

```

We then adjust this part of the Dockerfile, to ensure that `build_deps.sh` from the repository runs.

  > # Build dependencies using bash
  > RUN /bin/bash ./scripts/build_deps.sh
  >
  > # Build the app
  > RUN /bin/bash ./scripts/build.sh

This time, running the test script, successfully executed but with another problem: 

```
[!] No Android SDK found. Try setting the ANDROID_SDK_ROOT environment variable.
Error: building at STEP "RUN /bin/bash ./scripts/build.sh": while running runtime: exit status 1
```

We believe, we have set that in the Dockerfile, but to be doubly sure, we make changes to both Dockerfile and the WS elitewallet script:

```

The error for this attempt:

> 1. [!] No Android SDK found. Try setting the ANDROID_SDK_ROOT environment variable.
> Error: building at STEP "RUN export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT="/opt/android-sdk" ANDROID_HOME="/opt/android-sdk" FLUTTER_ROOT="/opt/flutter" PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/tools:$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/platform-tools" &&     /bin/bash ./scripts/build.sh": while running runtime: exit status 1

We try to modify it by setting `ENV PATH`:

```
ENV PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/platform-tools:$FLUTTER_ROOT/bin"
```

We also modify the Android SDK installation:

```
RUN mkdir -p "$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/cmdline-tools" && \
    wget -O android_sdk.zip https://dl.google.com/android/repository/commandlinetools-linux-8512546_latest.zip && \
    unzip android_sdk.zip -d "$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/cmdline-tools/latest" && \
    rm android_sdk.zip
```

And we also accept the licenses:

```
# Accept licenses
RUN yes | $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager --licenses
```

### In sc.elitewallet.elitewallet.sh script:

We replace the Android SDK root export path:

```
export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/platform-tools:$FLUTTER_ROOT/bin"
```

We then test it again and get:

```
STEP 6/17: RUN yes | $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager --licenses
/bin/sh: 1: /opt/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager: not found
```

We note the discrepancy in the folder for extraction:

```
Archive:  android_sdk.zip
 extracting: /opt/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/cmdline-tools/bin/avdmanager  
 extracting: /opt/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/cmdline-tools/bin/sdkmanager 
```

We also take note that it was trying to execute sdkmanager at:

```
STEP 6/17: RUN yes | $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager --licenses
/bin/sh: 1: /opt/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager: not found
```

We then ran the the test script with these changes, and it resulted in this error:

```

The plugin `ew_monero` uses a deprecated version of the Android embedding.
To avoid unexpected runtime failures, or future build failures, try to see if this plugin supports the Android V2 embedding. Otherwise, consider removing it since a future release of Flutter will remove these deprecated APIs.
If you are plugin author, take a look at the docs for migrating the plugin to the V2 embedding: https://flutter.dev/go/android-plugin-migration.

1. The SDK directory is not writable because the Docker build is running as a non-root user.
2. The solution offered was:

> temporarily switch to the root user to install the NDK components and then switch back to the non-root user for the rest of the build process.

We achieve this by adding this to line 31 of the dockerfile:

```
$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager "ndk;23.1.7779620"
```

Create and switch to a non-root user for the rest of the process at line 50:

```
chown -R appuser:appuser /opt/flutter /opt/android-sdk
```

At this juncture, I was able to run up to the last step which is to to run the fourth command for the **automatic build**, which is

`./scripts/build.sh`

This resulted in an error, of which this is the [tail-end pastebin.](https://pastebin.com/5iR8hCpz)

After several failed attempts, and with some errors emanating from the build.sh script, we'll have to mark this as **Failed to Build from Source**, until 
somebody could prove otherwise.

We also take note that elitewallet has opened a [merge request](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests/12936) on F-Droid in 2023. Multiple build failures led to the MR not getting merged.
