       Very annoying app. I placed a trade and later cancelled it. I was charged 14usdt for cancelling the trade. How is that even possible? Frustrating app.

       The network fee on withdrawal is too overwhelming ðŸ˜°... This is basically the worst ever platform I've ever used. 

## The Site

We had problems signing up to the service. It doesn't provide the verification email. This happened on the app and on the website.

We also were not able to locate the Terms and Conditions of the page.

## Verdict

This product or service is **defunct**.
