## The Site

From the homepage:

**Is BitForex safe?**
> BitForex offers industry-leading technical measures to ensure the safety of user assets and accounts. Backed by one of the world's most sophisticated maintenance teams.

It does not clarify what these technical measures are, or who is involved in the maintenance teams.

From the [Terms and Conditions](https://event.bitforex.com/en/Terms.html):

> If there is suspicious activity related to your Account, we have right to request additional information from you, including authenticating documents, and to freeze any transactions pending our review. We will then conduct an investigation and determine whether to unfreeze the account or permanently close it. During the investigation, deposits, withdrawals, and trading will be disabled. If we decide to close the account, the user will be allowed to withdraw all legally-owned funds.

Bitforex is a **custodial offering**, and is thus **non-verifiable.**
