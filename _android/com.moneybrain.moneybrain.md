## The Site

From the [General Terms and Conditions:](https://www.moneybrain.com/terms-conditions/)

> (e) We may disable your account at any time in our sole discretion without notice or explanation.

## The App

We tried the app and registered. It required both email and mobile verification.

While the app features a Personal Account and a Business Account, it is mandatory to complete identity verification first.

Users are redirected to a KYC application online.

We found a tab for Digital Assets and found it was possible to withdraw and deposit BTC. However, before you are given access to these features, you must first complete the KYC verification. 

## Verdict

We conclude that this is a **custodial** app and as such, **not verifiable.**
