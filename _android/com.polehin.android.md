The wallet re-branded at some point to Coinbox Bitcoin Wallet and is now a
**blatant scam**.

[As demonstrated by "BTC Sessions" Ben](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP_C4wZyikk)
the wallet features a mnemonic backup that is purely decorative and has nothing
to do with your wallet. Ben mentions a few more red flags that convinced us to
not give them the benefit of the doubt. This is the sort of wallet we try to
warn you of. It is also obfuscating the app, so it gets a bit harder to figure
out what's going on but the evidence as presented in the video leaves no other
conclusion.

**Do not use this app. You will lose your money.**
