## Analysis 

In their [FAQ](https://help.bravepay.net/?lang=en#bravePay-cat1-qa9):

> **What guarantees do I have on my funds?**
>
> BraveCorp is an entity that provides custody services for electronic wallets and the exchange of digital assets and fiat currency authorized by the Bank of Spain. The funds in your BravePay account are 100% guaranteed by 1:1 reserves in USDC.
>
> USDC (US Dollar Coin) is the digital version of the American dollar marketed by Circle, a financial multinational based in Boston, MA (USA) founded in 2013. With more than 55,000 million dollars in assets under management, USDC is guaranteed by reserves 1:1 in US dollars.

This is enough to say that this service is **custodial** and thus, **not-verifiable.**
