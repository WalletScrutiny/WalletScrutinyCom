## The App

We tested the app and they required the following: a username, phone number, email address, password and pin code. The options were home, swap, fund, withdraw, wallets, profile.

Buying, selling, funding, withdrawing and sending Bitcoin requires level 2 kyc verification. There's also a requirement to have $30 minimum deposit that apply to all addresses. We posted a [screenshot on twitter.](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1456159262871224321/photo/1)

## The Site

We found how Betadeal handles the private keys for the wallets on their [Terms and Conditions](https://www.betadeal.net/terms-conditions)

> "Betadeal securely stores all Digital Currency private keys in our control..."

## Verdict

Apps that have cryptocurrency wallet functionalities that require kyc **before** you can send and receive cryptocurrency act like a closed gate. This means that you cannot use the app if you haven't met their conditions. This also means that somebody has to approve your account before you can fully utilize this. This is the reason why we give this app a verdict of **custodial**, effectively making the app **not verifiable**.
