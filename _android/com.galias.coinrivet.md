## Analysis

This is a cryptocurrency exchange. 

Found on their [website:](https://coinrivet.com/faq-category/security/)

> **How does Coin Rivet keep my cryptocurrency safe?**
>
> A portion of all cryptocurrencies held by Coin Rivet is insured and kept in cold storage. However, this does not cover any losses resulting from unauthorised access to your personal Coin Rivet account due to breach or loss of your credentials.

As an exchange, the provider hosts the accounts of the user which contain the wallets. Keeping the cryptocurrencies in cold storage indicates that this is a **custodial** platform. The app is non-verifiable.
