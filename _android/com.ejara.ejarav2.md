## Analysis 

We downloaded the app and it featured a Bitcoin wallet that can send and receive. 

Most notably, it also provided the ability to backup the private keys using seed phrases.

It however does not make any claim that its source is public for audit.

It had a repository but they were unrelated to the Android or iOS apps.
