**Update 2021-12-03**: This appears to be the companion app to
{% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/ellipaltitan' verdict='true' %}.

This app comes with the claim:

> Secure HD wallet for cryptocurrencies. Store, transact, and trade Bitcoin and
  Crypto: BTC ETH LTC DGB BSV BAT OMG XRP XVG & 1000+ more.

and absent more explicit claims, we have to guess that HD means "hierarchically
deterministic", a standard for self-custodial wallets.

As we can't find a source code repository on their website or
[their company GitHub account](https://github.com/ELLIPAL?tab=repositories&type=source),
we assume the app is closed source and thus **not verifiable**.
