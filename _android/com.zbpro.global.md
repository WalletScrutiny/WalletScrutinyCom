- An error message appeared during registration:

> Registration is suspended until further notice.

- The mobile app later on allowed registration.
- The [terms](https://www.zb.com/help/service/3) complies with AML/KYC/CTF policies and has a termination clause.
- Section 4.4. Transactions are subject to approval and if they are determined to be of suspicious nature, can be suspended or terminated.
- The security section has the following options:
  - Phone verification
  - Google authentication
  - Transaction password
  - Transaction verification
  - Withdrawal verification
  - Gesture password
  - Face ID
  - Fingerprint unlock
  - Device management
- We did not find an option to backup the private keys.
- There is a BTC Deposit function that is currently suspended.
- As a cryptocurrency exchange with no means to backup the private keys for the user, this means this app is a **custodial** app.
