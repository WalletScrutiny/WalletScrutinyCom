## App Description from Google Play

> Bitcoin Trader app is designed in a manner that we can make quick and accurate changes; changes that will make our app more effective while offering little to no downtime for our traders. We understand the need to be up and running at all times because you never know when the market is going to offer a profitable trading opportunity. We would like to welcome you to the Bitcoin Trader App trading family and wish you success in your trading activities.

## Analysis 

- The app asked for several permissions and reminded us of a similar app. 
- Its interface looks like a mobile version of a website whose goal is to get your email address.
- There was a warning at the top rushing us to register.
  > Warning: Due to extremely high media demand, we will close registration as of 17/08/2023 - HURRY
- The app required us to register and deposit could be in credit or debit card, or via CryptoPayx
- This is a CFD trading platform, therefore this app would not be able to **send and receive bitcoin**.
