## Analysis 

- This app comes from the same developer as {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/jp.co.rakuten.wallet.leverage' verdict='true' %}
- The parent website of the app, issued this [press-release](https://global.rakuten.com/corp/news/press/2019/0819_02.html) describing the Rakuten Wallet as employing **cold-storage** for security.
- This means the app is a *custodial* app and is therefore **not-verifiable**.
