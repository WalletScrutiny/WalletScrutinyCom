On Google Play they claim

> SafePal is one of the earliest crypto wallet brands invested and backed by
  Binance

While Binance did review some SafePal hardware wallet, we can't find Binance
supporting the claim of investment. In particular, SafePal links to
[this Binance site](https://labs.binance.com/) where we find a list of
investments but no mention of SafePal.

On their website there is a whole list of "global leaders" that backed them but
here, the "Binance labs" link is a different one and
[dead](https://www.binancelabs.co/),
[this sponsor's website](https://bittemple.io/) uses a totally wrong ssl
certificate and none of the other supposed backers mentions SafePal on the
linked pages.

> SafePal cryptocurrency wallet application is a decentralized application.
  The mnemonic phrase is stored by users. SafePal does not read or store
  sensitive account information including private key and mnemonic phrase.

So they do claim to be non-custodial but there is no source code anywhere to be
found which makes the app **not verifiable**.
