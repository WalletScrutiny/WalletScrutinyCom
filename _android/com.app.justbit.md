       I had not received my deposit of INR, and there is no customer support, After successful deposition when i go to deposit history there was nothing to see, nor received in my wallet. They are just taking customer money and don't have customer support.

## Analysis 

- [Video](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1699264589060616511)
- The website listed in its Google Play page is not online.
- We tried to register, but there was an error:
  > Something went wrong
- With its website gone, it is no surprise that the app is no longer working. 

This is **defunct**.
