## Analysis 

- The website listed in its Google play page is currently offline
- The app just shows a white screen when run from the BlueStacks 5 emulator. 
- The app worked with our mobile device. 
- Contrary to its Play description, we were only able to see BEP20 and TRC20 wallets. There was **no bitcoin** supported by the bitcoin network.
