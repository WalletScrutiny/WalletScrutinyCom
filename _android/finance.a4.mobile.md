## Analysis

- Contrary to its claim that the app supports storing Bitcoin - we weren't able to find any evidence of this. [(Screenshot)](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWalletz/status/1676850271694254082)
- The available networks are:
  - BNB SC testnet
  - Polygon
  - Fantom
  - Avalanche
  - Solana
  - Tron
- There is a 'Custom Networks' option where users could add their own networks. The parameters include:
  - Name:
  - URL RPC:
  - Chain ID:
  - Token name:
  - Symbol:
  - Explorer URL:

We don't know if this could potentially add BTC. But from their description, we think support for BTC should allow this from the beginning. This is why we conclude that this app **does not support BTC**.
