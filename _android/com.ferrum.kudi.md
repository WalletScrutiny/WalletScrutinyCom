## Analysis 

There are many indications that the app is going close to being defunct. A majority of the links from its home page all link back to the index of the domain. 

We were able to find a [third-party video](https://youtu.be/wGf-3ZK4Buw?t=569) review of the app, which shows the ability to buy bitcoin through electronic bank transfer, as well as the ability to withdraw the BTC to another address. 

We were not able to install the app due to the app's requirement of using an older version of Android. 

It is highly likely that this was a custodial provider which is now in the brink of becoming defunct.
