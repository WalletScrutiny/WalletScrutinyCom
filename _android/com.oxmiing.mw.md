## Analysis 

- This is the [download page](https://www.oxbtc.com/foreign_download) for the official oxbtc.com website. It lists {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/com.iamswr_oxbtc_m.mwbpcontainer' verdict='true' %}, as the official app. 
- Given the chaotic history of the original app, we suspect that this app, could be another iteration. The purpose of so-called "cloud-mining" apps are already suspicious as it is. 
- However, since we could not find a link to this specific app from the website origin, and because of the Google Play reviews, we will mark this one as a **fake**.
