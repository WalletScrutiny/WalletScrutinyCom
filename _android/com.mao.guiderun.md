Bitpiedd cannot access user funds.

## Analysis 

- The app just displays the logo. 
- There is no website associated with this app.
- The app claims to be self-custodial, but we were [not able to find](https://github.com/search?q=com.mao.guiderun&type=code) any code on GitHub that corresponds to the app ID.
- This app, according to its description is non-custodial, but it is *not source-available* and more importantly, already **defunct**
