## Update 2024-07-24

It seems that relai app's Android repository is located [here](https://github.com/ademcan/relai-mobile-app/). However, it hasn't been updated in 5 years. The version on Google Play is version 2.8.12 which was updated on July 15, 2024. We communicated on X with who we determine is the developer of the app and received a response. The app is indeed [hosted in a private repository](https://x.com/_adembilican_/status/1816034453594030234).

## App Description from Google Play 2023-07-11

> You can buy Bitcoin in just a few clicks using your bank account, credit card, debit card, Apple Pay, or Google Pay.
>
> Relai's non-custodial wallet gives you full control of your Bitcoin. Safely store your 12-word recovery phrase, and recover your wallet anytime, anywhere.

## Analysis

- The provider claims to have a non-custodial wallet that supports Bitcoin.
- We searched on GitHub Code for the app ID, and found [8 results](https://github.com/search?q=com.relai&type=code) that are unrelated to the Android app.
- This app is **not source-available**.
