This app does not appear to be a crypto wallet, instead utilizing external services such as Skrill or CoinBase as its wallets.

Furthermore, here is the Play Store description:

> You want to claim multiple coins? , You don’t know where to store your coins? , You want to learn how to exchange your coins for currencies? <br>
Claimers Faucet Coins will cover all your cryptocurrency-related needs, presenting multiple ways to earn, store and exchange them. And best of all, everything from your mobile device.

This app does not have an official website, and the [app developer named "Vessper"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Vessper) has only developed [one additional app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.claimersmulticoins) with almost the exact same description.

This app is **not a wallet.**
