## Analysis 

We initially tagged this as custodial because of the description stating that **Crypstone keeps your bitcoin at the safest location**, but couldn't actually find a BTC address or QR code. The only option is to buy BTC using NGN (Nigerian Naira). Perhaps, this is due to their need for verification. But with that said, the Terms clearly states that cryptocurrency to cryptocurrency transfer is possible. We'll tentatively mark this as **custodial**, as we contacted them via web form.
