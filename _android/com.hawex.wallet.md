## Analysis 

- The website affiliated with this app is offline. 
- We tried 3 times, but the app's verification sms did not reach us. 
- As a result, we were not able to register. 
- We checked an archive of the website and found some information, including the url for its main site, hawex.com.
- Assuming the description is accurate, supports Bitcoin, and provides the private keys, the next step is to search for its source code. 
- Unfortunately, a search for the appID on GitHub, resulted in ['0 results'](https://hawex.com/)
- This app is **not source-available**.
