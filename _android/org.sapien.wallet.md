## Verdict

This is evidently a self-custodial wallet since it provided the mnemonics and the ability to backup. We searched online if the app had any source code, but [**we were not able to find any relevant repository.**](https://github.com/search?q=sapien+wallet&type=repositories) As there is no mention on whether source code is provided, this app is likely a **closed-source** project.
