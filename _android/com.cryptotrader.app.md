The app does not have a listed website or social media accounts. It is similar to the following:

> - {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/net.benoitbasset.ograpi' verdict='true' %}<br>
> - {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/net.oblade.krakapi' verdict='true' %}<br>

The app merely features cryptocurrency trading pair charts and provisions for entering the API keys for various exchanges: Huobi, Binance, Kucoin and HitBTC.

This app does **not have a bitcoin wallet.**
