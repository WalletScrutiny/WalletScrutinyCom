This app has wonderful security claims on Google Play:

> *5. STAY CAREFREE* With Conio you can recover your Bitcoins even if you forget
> all your credentials! Just create your profile and upload a selfie when you
> start.

Unfortunately this means that the provider does control the keys which makes it
a custodial app. Our verdict: **not verifiable**.
