## Analysis

Overall, this app:

- ☑ Supports BTC
- ☑ Allows users to create/restore wallets with 12 word secret phrases
- ☒ Does not appear to have available source code

From the app's description page:

> We support a wide range of popular cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and more, giving you the freedom to manage multiple assets from a single wallet. Rest assured, your diverse holdings are safe within our trustworthy crypto wallet.

Here [is a page](https://yusetoken.io/decoding-security-the-power-of-12-word-phrases-in-defi-wallets/) on Yuse Wallet's official site that walks through the process of working with the user's "12-word phrase". 

Upon installing this app to test for ourselves, we find that users are allowed to create or restore existing wallets. The app has support for multiple networks including BTC and Ethereum. 

We could not find a hint at the code repository being public on their website. Searching for the app's [ID in GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=%22com.yuse.wallet%22&type=code) did not yield promising results neither.
