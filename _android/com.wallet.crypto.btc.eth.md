## Analysis 

- ☑️ Supports Bitcoin
- ☑️ Can send/receive Bitcoin
- ☑️ Provides seed-phrases
- Has a GitHub organization page with a mostly [empty repository](https://github.com/Ironwallet/IronWallet) for the app.

## Other Observations

This app seems to be new but strangely already has 500,000 users.  Social media links seem to have been removed from their homepage, but already exist in platforms such as x.com. Nevertheless, we created an [issue in their Github](https://github.com/Ironwallet/IronWallet/issues/1) just in case they change their minds and decide to make the source available. Tentatively, this app is **not source-available**.
