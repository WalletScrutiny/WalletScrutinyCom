**Update 2021-04-30**: This app is no more and probably scammed some people as
the original analysis below suggests.

### Original Analysis

This app is a fake version of
{% include walletLink.html wallet='android/piuk.blockchain.android' %}.

As most of those scams, it uses some fake reviews but they are using a variation
of the old logo of Blockchain.com's wallet and the provider is

`Blockchain Luxembourg L.A.` instead of<br>
`Blockchain Luxembourg S.A.`

For lack of a scam verdict, we leave this as WIP for now and assume it'll be
defunct in no time.
