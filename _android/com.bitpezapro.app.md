  ★☆☆☆☆ September 23, 2021 <br>
       Zero Customer service. I actually enjoy the early days of Bekonta. Initially, withdrawal took just minutes to be processed. Yesterday it took them more than 5 hours to process my withdrawal request. Today, it's almost getting to 6 hours. Imagine that I needed my money urgently for something? It's time you guys wake up to meet up with the competition out there.

## The Site

The Terms and Conditions of the site indicate a termination clause

> Suspension, Termination and Cancellation. We may:<br>
  (a) refuse to complete, or block, cancel or reverse a transaction you have authorised (even after funds have been debited from your Bekonta Account),<br>
  (b) suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to any or all of the Bekonta Services, and/or<br>
  (c) deactivate or cancel your Bekonta Account with immediate effect for any reason, including but not limited to where:

## The App

There are options for creating addresses for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tron, Binance, Tether and Binance USD. However, prior to wallet creation, the user is required to provide KYC information. 

## Verdict

Provisions that explicitly give the platform the right or the power to "suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to any part of the service..." is a good indicator for a **custodial** service. 

This app **cannot be verified.**
