## App Description

It appears to be a service that allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum.

> Buy & sell Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies at anytime, anywhere.

## The Site

Curiously, the site digiexchange.net upon first visit, initially shows a privacy warning. Proceeding redirects to a .biz domain of the same name.

## The App

Registration involves sending several KYC documents that we deem to be intrusive. We did not proceed with registration and opted instead to converse with their support. 

## Contact

We chatted via [twitter](https://twitter.com/dannybuntu/status/1442779355034181635) and via their on-page support.

We asked if the app provides a wallet for bitcoin since in our experience, Iranian sites usually require third-party bitcoin wallets for buying and selling. 

This was the reply:

> ما فقط خرید و فروش انجام میدیم و برای نگهدار ارز خودتون باید کیف پول داشته 

Translated via Google Translate:

> We only trade and you have to have a wallet to keep your currency

### Verdict

This app **does not have a bitcoin wallet**.
