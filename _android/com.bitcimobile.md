## Analysis 

We were not able to download the app. Based on the description it is a Turkish bitcoin exchange. It is possible to buy many cryptocurrencies including BTC on the exchange. 

We could not find documentation pertaining to the private keys on the site. 

There are deposit and withdrawal limits. 

This app is a **custodial** service.
