## Verdict

IdeyPay claims to store the private keys in the [cloud](https://ideypay.com/bitcoin). Although, it does not mention who has control or access to this. Piecing together clues, we'd find that since it has the right to discontinue access to any portion of their service, the user can be left with no method to retrieve his or her bitcoin. This means that this service is **custodial** and the app is **not verifiable**.
