Bitcoin Knots is a fork of Bitcoin Core maintained by Luke Dash Jr.

> Compared to Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Knots offers significantly more mempool and mining configurability to node operators and miners. Node operators and miners should have that configurability, Dashjr believes, because they need to verify, store and transmit transactions and blocks over the Bitcoin network; all of which comes at a cost to them. 
>
>With Bitcoin Knots, node operators and miners can enable first-seen, opt-in replace-by-fee, as well as full replace-by-fee mempool policies, plus select a myriad of additional conditions to accept or reject (unconfirmed) transactions. Miners, furthermore, can easily lower the maximum size of blocks they mine, from 1 megabyte downward. They can also change the priority size in blocks reserved for bitcoins that have not been used for a while, and can adjust how many low-fee transactions they are willing to include: two anti-spam measures.
