**Update:** This app was earlier classified as non-custodial but as their main
selling point is their *"Unfairly cheap and blazing fast transactions on
Bitcoin"* Lighning Wallet and that wallet is custodial without warning the user
about this fact, we have to change our verdict although in summary the verdict
remains **not verifiable**.
