Enjin: Blockchain & Crypto Wallet
description starts promising:

> "Your private keys are your own"

They advertise advanced securing techniques among which are:

> "An extensive independent security audit and penetration test found no
> security issues."

(You can read the report [here](https://cdn.enjin.io/files/pdfs/enjin-wallet-security-audit.pdf))

but source code isn't available on [their website](https://github.com/enjin).
So the user is left with only one choice: trust.

Our verdict: **not verifiable**.
