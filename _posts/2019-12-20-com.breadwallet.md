This wallet claims not to be custodial and we found its supposed
[source code](https://github.com/breadwallet/breadwallet-android)
but we found no claim of verifiability and so verification was difficult.

**Update:** The team reacted quickly to our reach-out after our first analysis via
[this issue](https://github.com/breadwallet/breadwallet-android/issues/117) on
their GitHub.

Now we find a tag `build-3.14.3.3` and can try to compile that:

```
$ git tag | grep 3.14.3
build-3.14.3.3
$ git checkout build-3.14.3.3
...
HEAD is now at a332b4d5 Merge branch 'pablobu/DROID-1497' into 'release/3.14.3'
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ docker run -v $PWD:/mnt -it beevelop/cordova bash
root@e34a31867b99:/tmp# cd /mnt/
root@e34a31867b99:/mnt# yes | $ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin/sdkmanager "platforms;android-28"
root@e34a31867b99:/mnt# ./gradlew :app:assemble
root@e34a31867b99:/mnt# ls app/build/outputs/apk/brd/release/*.apk
brd-release-3.14.2.1.apk  output.json
```

Now that doesn't look promising, given we need version `3.14.3` and indeed the
diff is huge and goes across many code files.

The content of AboutActivity for example confirms its the wrong version. Many of the
differences look harmless like this:

```
diff -r fromBuild/smali/com/breadwallet/presenter/activities/settings/AboutActivity.smali fromPlayStore/smali/com/breadwallet/presenter/activities/settings/AboutActivity.smali
157c157
<     const-string v4, "3.14.2"
---
>     const-string v4, "3.14.3"
```

But with these diffs we can't give it a pass:

```
Binary files fromBuild/lib/arm64-v8a/libcore.so and fromPlayStore/lib/arm64-v8a/libcore.so differ
Binary files fromBuild/lib/armeabi-v7a/libcore.so and fromPlayStore/lib/armeabi-v7a/libcore.so differ
Binary files fromBuild/lib/x86/libcore.so and fromPlayStore/lib/x86/libcore.so differ
Binary files fromBuild/lib/x86_64/libcore.so and fromPlayStore/lib/x86_64/libcore.so differ
```

Diffoscope yields user directories in its 397662 lines of diff:

```

This looks like NDK being the culprit for part of the diff, apart from it being
the wrong version. Hopefully with Docker this can be improved.

Our verdict
-----------

We conclude that we hope for a quick resolution of the issues but for now
this wallet remains **not verifiable**.
