warnings:
- severity: medium
  short: Weak privacy!
  message: |
    This wallet connects to servers of the provider to query transactions and
    balances. The provider can log all addresses of all your accounts. Although
    they promised not to do so it is hard to know for sure. Things that can be
    done about this issue:
    
    * Convince the provider to implement BIP158
    * Convince the provider to let you connect to your own full node
- severity: medium
  short: Liquid might not be as trust-less as advertised!
  message: |
    The supported liquid network might degrade to a custodial wallet
    [as has happened in the past](https://twitter.com/_prestwich/status/1276318599410364416)!
- severity: low
  short: 2of2 signature feature has negative side effects
  message: |
    The wallet provides a security feature that allows you to define spending
    limits so a thief cannot empty your wallet without a server of the provider
    approving this transaction. While this feature can help save your funds, it
    also comes at a cost:
    
    * Your transaction history is necessarily known to the provider.
    * Your transaction history is mostly visible on the blockchain as your
      change output goes to this very special script again.
    * Your funds might be temporarily locked when you urgently need them.
    * The feature only works if you roll funds over: If you go without doing any
      transactions for a while, you also lose the benefits until you do a new
      transaction.
    * Transactions are more expensive as the more complicated script requires
      more space on the blockchain.
    * Funds protected by this feature cannot be discovered by any other wallet.
      As the wallet is fully transparent, this could be worked around if the
      provider went away from one day to the other.
      
    There is a misconception that this feature would allow the provider to hold
    the users' funds ransom but to our knowledge this is not the case as it is
    a 2-of-2 script with a timeout after which the server's key is not needed
    anymore.
