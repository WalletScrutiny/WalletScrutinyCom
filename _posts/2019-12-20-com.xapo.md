Xapo describes itself
as a wallet:

> Weâ€™re a digital wallet that allows you to easily and safely send, receive,
> store and spend any traditional currencies and bitcoin.

but under closer investigation, we can't find any Bitcoin wallet here. Naming
"traditional currencies" and "bitcoin" in the same security
claim sound like it has to be custodial.

Their [website on security](https://xapo.com/en/security) is not claiming
otherwise neither which makes us conclude: This app is **not verifiable**.
