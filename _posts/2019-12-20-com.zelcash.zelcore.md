This application claims on their Google Play description:

> Ultimate security provided with no personal user information being stored
> off-device.

and

> Single master seed backup (This will be the only seed you will ever need in
> the future for any coin we integrate)

which sounds like a non-custodial wallet but neither on Google Play nor on their
website do we find a link to the source code, so their claims are **not
verifiable**.
